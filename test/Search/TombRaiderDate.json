True to the game's name, the game involved Lara exploring tombs and ruins in search of ancient artifacts. The game was developed by <a href=\"\/core-design-ltd\/3010-318\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-318\">Core Design<\/a> and published by <a href=\"\/eidos-interactive\/3010-658\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-658\">Eidos Interactive<\/a>. It was released first for the <a href=\"\/saturn\/3045-42\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-42\">Sega Saturn<\/a> but became available soon after for the <a href=\"\/playstation\/3045-22\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PlayStation<\/a>, <a href=\"\/pc\/3045-94\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/mac\/3045-17\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-17\">Mac<\/a>. The game proved extremely successful and spawned the now legendary Tomb Raider franchise. The game was re-released with two extra chapters in 1998 as Tomb Raider Gold, and was later remade by <a href=\"\/crystal-dynamics-inc\/3010-959\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-959\">Crystal Dynamics<\/a> with updated graphics and gameplay in <a href=\"\/lara-croft-tomb-raider-anniversary\/3030-8201\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8201\">Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Anniversary<\/a>.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><p>The game opens with a short cutscene in Los Alamos, New Mexico. A nuclear test in the desert causes an earthquake which reveals an ancient artifact. The game then jumps forward to present day, where Lara is given a cryptic mission by <a href=\"\/jacqueline-natla\/3005-2954\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2954\">Ms. Jacqueline Natla<\/a> through a laptop delivered to her by Natla's assistant <a href=\"\/larson\/3005-2955\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2955\">Larson<\/a>. Lara's interest is piqued when she is informed that there is an ancient artifact -- <a href=\"\/scion\/3055-2337\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2337\">the Scion<\/a> -- in the unexplored tomb of <a href=\"\/qualopec\/3005-11326\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-11326\">Qualopec<\/a> in Peru. Lara takes the job, and the game begins.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17421\/627498-tomb1_2008_09_03_19_16_56_53.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-627498\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17421\/627498-tomb1_2008_09_03_19_16_56_53.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-627498\"><img alt=\"Lara sprints across a bridge.  \" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/bundles\/phoenixsite\/images\/core\/loose\/img_broken.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/bundles\/phoenixsite\/images\/core\/loose\/img_broken.png 1024w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/bundles\/phoenixsite\/images\/core\/loose\/img_broken.png 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/bundles\/phoenixsite\/images\/core\/loose\/img_broken.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/a><figcaption>Lara sprints across a bridge.  <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The gameplay takes place in ruins across four locations: Peru, Greece, Egypt, and Atlantis. The player must navigate Lara through these ruins in search of three Scion artifacts. The game is presented from a third-person perspective with the camera following directly behind Lara. The player has no direct camera control. The game uses <a href=\"\/tank-controls\/3015-4647\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4647\">tank controls<\/a>, which helps with methodically lining up very precise jumps, but hinders fast action situations like combat.<\/p><p>Lara has an array of moves and abilities which she can use to navigate tricky platforming obstacles, traverse expansive 3D spaces, battle dangerous foes, and solve environmental puzzles. Some of these basic skills include running, jumping, flipping, turning, rolling, scaling ledges, swimming, firing weapons, and shimmying sideways until there is room.<\/p><p>An optional tutorial called Lara's House can be played from the main menu. It takes place in Lara's family manor, and presents a short series of simple platforming scenarios for the player to practice as Lara narrates directions.<\/p><p>Upon completing a level, an end-level screen is displayed showing the player's stats for that level, such as number of kills, number of secrets found, and time taken. (Beware that the last level of the game has a bug that prevents one of its secrets from being properly counted.) Most levels' entry points are modeled to match the exit of the preceding level to give the sense of the levels connecting directly together, which helps the gameworld feel larger and more immersive.<\/p><p>During gameplay, Lara has two stances which she can flip between: holding weapons and not holding weapons. In her weapon stance, pressing the action button fires her weapons, her only method of fighting and defeating enemies. In her non-weapon stance, pressing the action button makes Lara grab or operate objects in the environment, which is crucial for climbing and puzzle solving. Her default weapon is the dual pistols, which is the weakest weapon in the game, but the only one with infinite ammo. She can also use dual magnums, dual Uzis, and a shotgun. Ammo for these other three weapons can be found scattered about levels. Normal enemies do not drop anything, but a few bosses drop unique items like keys or weapons.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17421\/629100-tomb1_2008_09_04_15_21_28_46.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-629100\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17421\/629100-tomb1_2008_09_04_15_21_28_46.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-629100\"><img alt=\"Lara falls through a collapsing floor.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/bundles\/phoenixsite\/images\/core\/loose\/img_broken.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/bundles\/phoenixsite\/images\/core\/loose\/img_broken.png 1024w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/bundles\/phoenixsite\/images\/core\/loose\/img_broken.png 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/bundles\/phoenixsite\/images\/core\/loose\/img_broken.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Lara falls through a collapsing floor.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/bundles\/phoenixsite\/images\/core\/loose\/img_broken.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/bundles\/phoenixsite\/images\/core\/loose\/img_broken.png 1024w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/bundles\/phoenixsite\/images\/core\/loose\/img_broken.png 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/bundles\/phoenixsite\/images\/core\/loose\/img_broken.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Lara falls through a collapsing floor.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>There are many hazards that can hurt Lara, including traps, attacks from enemies, falling from great heights, and running out of air while underwater. To recover her health, Lara can use Small and Large Medipacks from her inventory. Medipacks are found scattered about levels. Lara keeps all items (Medipacks, weapons, and ammo) from one level to the next, so excess supplies gathered early in the game can be saved and used later in the game as it becomes harder, at least until all of Lara's items are reset in the last chapter of the game for story reasons. Lara also starts each new level with her health restored to full.<\/p><p>Some hazards can kill Lara even at full health, such as falling into a spike trap, being flattened by a rolling boulder, or being caught by a boss's <a href=\"\/grapple\/3015-1622\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1622\">grapple attacks<\/a>. Upon death, the player must reload a saved game to resume playing. There are no auto saves, so the only saves to reload are ones the player has made manually.<\/p><p>To save one's progress in the game, the player must use a Save Crystal in the Saturn and PlayStation versions of the game, while in PC and Mac versions, the player may freely save anywhere. Save Crystals are relatively sparse throughout the game, with each level having only a few, and the scarcity of saving is one source of the game's difficulty and tension.<\/p><h2>Reception<\/h2><p>Tomb Raider was widely lauded by the public and press, going on to sell an astonishing 8 million copies. The cutting edge graphics, atmospheric levels, stylish gameplay, cinematic presentation, and almost unheard of use of a female protagonist captured the public's attention. The game was a huge financial success that turned Eidos Interactive's financial woes around over-night. Lara Croft herself became an icon even outside of video games, appearing on magazine covers and eventually branching into Hollywood. Two Tomb Raider films were made featuring Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft.<\/p>","expected_release_day":null,"expected_release_month":null,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":null,"guid":"3030-3023","id":3023,"image":{"icon_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/217714-tombraiderpccover.jpg","medium_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/217714-tombraiderpccover.jpg","screen_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/217714-tombraiderpccover.jpg","screen_large_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/screen_kubrick\/217714-tombraiderpccover.jpg","small_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/217714-tombraiderpccover.jpg","super_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/217714-tombraiderpccover.jpg","thumb_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/217714-tombraiderpccover.jpg","tiny_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/217714-tombraiderpccover.jpg","original_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/217714-tombraiderpccover.jpg","image_tags":"All Images"},"image_tags":[{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-3023\/?filter=image_tag%3AAll+Images","name":"All Images","total":59},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-3023\/?filter=image_tag%3ABox+Art","name":"Box Art","total":11},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-3023\/?filter=image_tag%3ACommercial+Ad","name":"Commercial Ad","total":1},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-3023\/?filter=image_tag%3APC+Screenshots","name":"PC Screenshots","total":39},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-3023\/?filter=image_tag%3AScreenshots","name":"Screenshots","total":4}],"name":"Tomb Raider","number_of_user_reviews":0,"original_game_rating":[{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game_rating\/3065-1\/","id":1,"name":"ESRB: T"},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game_rating\/3065-5\/","id":5,"name":"BBFC: 15"}],"original_release_date":"1996-10-31 00:00:00","platforms":[{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/platform\/3045-17\/","id":17,"name":"Mac","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/mac\/3045-17\/","abbreviation":"MAC"},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/platform\/3045-22\/","id":22,"name":"PlayStation","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/playstation\/3045-22\/","abbreviation":"PS1"},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/platform\/3045-34\/","id":34,"name":"N-Gage","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/n-gage\/3045-34\/","abbreviation":"NGE"},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/platform\/3045-42\/","id":42,"name":"Saturn","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/saturn\/3045-42\/","abbreviation":"SAT"},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/platform\/3045-94\/","id":94,"name":"PC","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/pc\/3045-94\/","abbreviation":"PC"},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/platform\/3045-96\/","id":96,"name":"iPhone","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/iphone\/3045-96\/","abbreviation":"IPHN"},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/platform\/3045-121\/","id":121,"name":"iPad","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/ipad\/3045-121\/","abbreviation":"IPAD"},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/platform\/3045-123\/","id":123,"name":"Android","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/android\/3045-123\/","abbreviation":"ANDR"}],"site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/tomb-raider\/3030-3023\/"},{"aliases":"TR 2\nTomb Raider 2\nTomb Raider II: The Dagger of Xian","api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game\/3030-337\/","date_added":"2008-04-01 01:36:16","date_last_updated":"2018-03-31 18:49:58","deck":"The second title in the Tomb Raider franchise.

The dagger was previously used by the Chinese Emperor to turn himself into a dragon by stabbing the dagger into his heart. He was eventually defeated when a group of Tibetan monks succeeded in removing the dagger from his heart and sealing it inside of the Great Wall for safe keeping.<\/p><p>The game begins with Lara discovering the entrance chamber to the holding place of the Dagger. As soon as she notices the key to the chamber is missing, she is attacked by a man who claims to work for <a href=\"\/marco-bartoli\/3005-2958\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2958\">Marco Bartoli<\/a>, the leader of the Venetian mob. Lara soon discovers that Bartoli and his criminal associates have founded a secret cult obsessed with the dagger, and she proceeds to track him through Venice, his hideout, and then eventually makes it on to his private plane on its way to an oil rig in the Adriatic Sea.<\/p><p>Lara learns for that cult is excavating a sunken ship by the name of the Maria Doria. A captured TIbetan monk, named <a href=\"\/brother-chan\/3005-18779\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-18779\">Brother Chan<\/a>, informs her that the ship carries an artifact, called the Seraph, which serves as the key to another artifact, called the Talion, which, in turn, is the key to Dagger of Xian. Chan also tells Lara that he is from an ancient order of monks who live at the Barkhang monastery and have sworn to protect the Tallion. Chan also lets on that the Barkhang monks were ones who sunk the Maria Doria in the first place. However, before Chan can tell Lara any more information, he is shot by Bartoli, prompting Lara to dive into the ship and retrieve the Seraph.<\/p><p>After collecting the Seraph, Lara journeys the Barkhang Monastery and retrieves the Talion. She then travels back to the Great Wall. After a car chase with Bartoli, Lara opens the door of the Dagger of Xian's chamber. However, before she can collect the dagger, Bartoli puts it through his heart and turns into a dragon. Lara defeats the dragon and succeeds in pulling the dagger out of Bartoli's heart.<\/p><p>However, the remainder of Bartolis' men track down Lara at her mansion and invade it. Lara collects her shotgun and successfully defends her home from the intruders.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>New gameplay features that Tomb Raider II introduced were new weapons, extra moves, vehicles, larger levels, more enemies, and lighting effects.

This is the first time that dinosaurs have appeared in a Tomb Raider game since the original.<\/p><h3>London<\/h3><p>Lara travels atop rooftops, through subway stations, and other urban areas of London.<\/p><h3>Antarctica<\/h3><p>The final stages of Lara's journey sees her confront the final villain, after traversing the harsh Antarctic climate. The game also introduces a freezing mechanic to water sections; Lara will start to take damage if she is submerged for too long, this meter drains quicker than the breath meter. These levels range from exploring Antarctica's surface, to descending the depths below.<\/p><h2>PC Requirements<\/h2><ul><li style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\"><b>OS:<\/b> Windows 95\/98\/Me\/XP<\/li><li><b>Processor:<\/b> Pentium 166 (Min.), Pentium 200 (Rec.)<\/li><li>4x CD-ROM (Min.)<\/li><li><b>Memory:<\/b> 16MB RAM (Min.), 32MB (Rec.)<\/li><li><b>Graphics:<\/b> Direct3D compliant 3D accelerator card<\/li><li><b>Sound:<\/b> DirectX 6 compatible sound card<\/li><li>Mouse &amp; Keyboard.<\/li><\/ul>","expected_release_day":null,"expected_release_month":null,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":null,"guid":"3030-19596","id":19596,"image":{"icon_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/1810972-box_traider3.png","medium_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/1810972-box_traider3.png","screen_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/1810972-box_traider3.png","screen_large_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/screen_kubrick\/1810972-box_traider3.png","small_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/1810972-box_traider3.png","super_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/1810972-box_traider3.png","thumb_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/1810972-box_traider3.png","tiny_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/1810972-box_traider3.png","original_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/1810972-box_traider3.png","image_tags":"All Images,Box Art"},"image_tags":[{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-19596\/?filter=image_tag%3AAll+Images","name":"All Images","total":53},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-19596\/?filter=image_tag%3ABox+Art","name":"Box Art","total":5},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-19596\/?filter=image_tag%3APC+Screenshots","name":"PC Screenshots","total":4},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-19596\/?filter=image_tag%3APS1+Screenshots","name":"PS1 Screenshots","total":26},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-19596\/?filter=image_tag%3AScreenshots","name":"Screenshots","total":16}],"name":"Tomb Raider III: Adventures of Lara Croft","number_of_user_reviews":0,"original_game_rating":[{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game_rating\/3065-1\/","id":1,"name":"ESRB: T"}],"original_release_date":"1998-11-21 00:00:00","platforms":[{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/platform\/3045-17\/","id":17,"name":"Mac","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/mac\/3045-17\/","abbreviation":"MAC"},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/platform\/3045-22\/","id":22,"name":"PlayStation","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/playstation\/3045-22\/","abbreviation":"PS1"},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/platform\/3045-94\/","id":94,"name":"PC","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/pc\/3045-94\/","abbreviation":"PC"}],"site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/tomb-raider-iii-adventures-of-lara-croft\/3030-19596\/"},{"aliases":null,"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game\/3030-39083\/","date_added":"2012-07-21 09:37:15","date_last_updated":"2015-11-11 00:43:35","deck":"The game takes place in Egypt, and occurs several months after the events of Tomb Raider.

Von Croy has been asked to find five Obscura Paintings for a client named Eckhardt, who is somewhat psychotic, and Von Croy fears for his life. However, Lara is rather reluctant to help after the events in The Last Revelation, and tells her mentor he should handle it himself. But seconds later Von Croy is dead and Lara is suspected of his murder. Being chased by French police, Lara has to escape and prove her innocence.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>Angel of Darkness retained most of the same style of gameplay as the previous Tomb Raider games, adding in some new skills to Lara's moveset, as well as some new skills for the new playable character, Kurtis Trent. These new moves include:<\/p><ul><li><b>Stealth<\/b> Allowing Lara to sneak around and take out her enemies in silence, and avoiding combat while on the run. It could also be used to hug walls and peer around corners.<\/li><li><b>Farsee<\/b> This allows Kurtis to see further into levels, and is only usable in certain areas and cutscenes.<\/li><li><b>Unarmed Combat<\/b> Allowing for hand to hand fighting.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Changes from other games in the series<\/h3><p>Angel Of Darkness went in a different direction from previous games. One of the most notable features was the removal of Lara' trademark akimbo pistols.<\/p><p>New features:<\/p><ul><li><b>Skill system<\/b> The game includes a simple \"upgrade\" system, that allows the player to improve Lara's upper and lower body strength stats. This allowed her to grip for longer, awarded her new moves and allowed her to access areas previously inaccessible. Most of these upgrades were obtained during the course of the game. The skills were only upgraded by performing very specific actions and so the whole thing was really just a fancy key system - you had to find the running \"key\" so you could get through the tunnel in time.<\/li><li><b>Improved graphics<\/b> Lara was redesigned to look more like a real person and less cartoonish. As well as this, the power of the PS2 and PC allowed the game to look smoother and more realistic, leading to better looking environments.<\/li><li><b>Additional playable character<\/b> Kurtis Trent was introduced in the game and was playable for a few levels and had some psychic abilities<\/li><\/ul><h2>Characters<\/h2><table><tbody><tr><td><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13239\/518024-tomb_raider_angel_darkness_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-518024\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.67341040462428\" data-width=\"346\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 346px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13239\/518024-tomb_raider_angel_darkness_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-518024\"><img alt=\"Lara Croft\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/13239\/518024-tomb_raider_angel_darkness_3.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/13239\/518024-tomb_raider_angel_darkness_3.jpg 346w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/13239\/518024-tomb_raider_angel_darkness_3.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>Lara Croft<\/figcaption><\/figure> A series of recent events have cast a shadow over Lara's life.

Early European texts mention the instance of a 14th Century genius known as the Black Alchemist who seems to have shared many of the same characteristics as Eckhardt. There are also unconfirmed rumors of Eckhardt being imprisoned for over 500 years in a containment pit until his apparent escape in 1945. After this, Eckhardt set about the revival of an ancient biblical race known as the Nephilim.<\/p><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><h2>Reception<\/h2><p>On release AoD was not well received. While it received some praise for its looks and sounds, a lot of the other features were heavily criticized, such as the combat, camera, and control systems. Also, after many delays, it still featured a lot of bugs, especially on the PC, which also had relatively high system requirements for the time. Because of this the game was often regarded as unfinished and rushed.<\/p><p>Problems included:<\/p><ul><li>Missing textures on surfaces and characters - one character actually had no face, just a hole where his face should be.<\/li><li>Certain weapons seemed to have been left out, such as Lara's famous dual pistols. The game starts her with one pistol, with the idea of finding another later, however any other pistol found just gave extra ammo. In the PC version a cheat could be entered to take the user to a secret \"level\", which was a black room with every item in the game, including the dual pistols.<\/li><li>A new feature was to be an RPG-like character interaction element with dialogue trees. This seemed to have been abandoned during development as you only get to talk to a couple of characters and the choice of dialogue you make has no effect in the game. Each conversation can be instantly restarted by talking to the character again and making different choices, meaning you could keep retrying getting a different conclusion each time.<\/li><li>The PC control scheme was changed from the traditional layout to a cumbersome mouse control.<\/li><\/ul>","expected_release_day":null,"expected_release_month":null,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":null,"guid":"3030-6742","id":6742,"image":{"icon_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/1881092-box_traidertaod.png","medium_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/1881092-box_traidertaod.png","screen_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/1881092-box_traidertaod.png","screen_large_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/screen_kubrick\/1881092-box_traidertaod.png","small_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/1881092-box_traidertaod.png","super_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/1881092-box_traidertaod.png","thumb_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/1881092-box_traidertaod.png","tiny_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/1881092-box_traidertaod.png","original_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/1881092-box_traidertaod.png","image_tags":"All Images,Box Art"},"image_tags":[{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-6742\/?filter=image_tag%3AAll+Images","name":"All Images","total":196},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-6742\/?filter=image_tag%3ABox+Art","name":"Box Art","total":2},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-6742\/?filter=image_tag%3APC+Screenshots","name":"PC Screenshots","total":172},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-6742\/?filter=image_tag%3AScreenshots","name":"Screenshots","total":11},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-6742\/?filter=image_tag%3AWallpaper","name":"Wallpaper","total":6}],"name":"Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness","number_of_user_reviews":0,"original_game_rating":[{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game_rating\/3065-1\/","id":1,"name":"ESRB: T"},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game_rating\/3065-36\/","id":36,"name":"PEGI: 12+"}],"original_release_date":"2003-06-20 00:00:00","platforms":[{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/platform\/3045-17\/","id":17,"name":"Mac","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/mac\/3045-17\/","abbreviation":"MAC"},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/platform\/3045-19\/","id":19,"name":"PlayStation 2","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/playstation-2\/3045-19\/","abbreviation":"PS2"},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/platform\/3045-94\/","id":94,"name":"PC","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/pc\/3045-94\/","abbreviation":"PC"}],"site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/lara-croft-tomb-raider-the-angel-of-darkness\/3030-6742\/"},{"aliases":"Tomb Raider 7","api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game\/3030-8554\/","date_added":"2008-04-01 15:46:39","date_last_updated":"2018-08-16 23:03:19","deck":"Lara travels across the world in search of a legendary artifact.

Her outfit has also been modified and updated for the times. Her default outfit is a brown t-shirt and booty shorts. The character model was changed as a way to attract a female demographic and remove the stigma of being nothing but a sex symbol for teenage boys.<\/p><h2>Equipment<\/h2><ul><li><a href=\"\/dual-wielding\/3015-135\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-135\">Dual Wielding<\/a> <a href=\"\/pistol\/3055-59\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-59\">Pistols<\/a> - The reliable and lethal weapon of choice for Lara Croft<\/li><li><a href=\"\/shotgun\/3055-114\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-114\">Shotgun<\/a> - A highly effective close range weapon.

She finds a vacant casket and none other than Pierre DuPont, who demands she give him Qualopec\u2019s piece of the Scion. Pierre himself uncovered <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11325\" href=\"\/tihocan\/3005-11325\/\">Tihocan<\/a>\u2019s piece. Lara refuses, and they fight for each others piece. Pierre escapes the tomb, but triggers two large Centaur bosses outside to come alive. Pierre believes they only want to protect the Scion and hands it over to Lara, to save himself. The Centaurs crush and kill Pierre before turning their attention to Lara. She defeats them and turns her attention to the final piece, located in the Sanctuary of the Scion, in Egypt.<\/p><p>Lara fights her way through, reaching the deeper parts of the temple. After recovering the final piece of the Scion she puts together all three. A flash-back reveals the full story of the third ruler, who is exposed as Natla. True to her personality, power-hungry, she seized control of the armies of Atlantis and used them against the very people she ruled over. Qualopec and Tihocan imprisoned her for the crimes she committed. She was incased in the crystalline formation where she later escaped from in Los Alamos. Natla\u2019s hired mercenaries arrive and Natla takes the connected pieces from Lara. They take her weapons and Natla orders them to shoot her. Larson fires, missing Lara on purpose. Lara escapes the fight from a cliff into the water below. Natla and her Mercenaries drive away on a nearby boat. Lara chases them on her motorcycle and takes a nearby jump, landing on the boat. She hides in the hull.<\/p><p>They arrive at the Lost Island. A place Natla has been excavating for some time. Mining equipment and rail lines have been placed within. After working around a blockade deep in the caves, Lara is greeted by Larson, who has disabled a mine-cart she needs in order to proceed. Larson refuses to hand over the fuse she needs, and believes she won\u2019t harm him. He keeps pushing her until she can take no more, firing three shots into Larson, killing him. She hesitates afterward, feeling the guilt of what she did. She decidedly moves on, haunted by the decision to kill him. Later she is encountered by the other two mercenaries who taunt her. One of them, The Kid, attempts to shoot her. She dodges the attack and the other mercenary, Kold, turns. He lunges at The Kid with a knife, stabbing him so he can have Lara to himself. Then he turns his interest to her. He pushes her up against the wall and grabs her by the throat. With his back turned, The Kid shoots Kold in the back, before finally dying. Lara is saved, and moves deeper into the caves leaving their bodies behind.<\/p><p>Lara arrives in a chamber. Natla stands before her and proclaims that she has the power to bring on the Seventh Age, something Qualopec and Tihocan were not capable of doing themselves. Natla has the completed Scion in her possession. Lara destroys the Scion. Natla furiously charges at Lara sending them both over a ledge into a pit of lava. Lara instinctively shoots her grapple to a nearby ledge, saving herself. Natla falls into the lava.<\/p><p>Lara pulls herself up and fights through a mini-boss above the very same pit of lava. After killing the monster she later arrives at another large chamber. Natla confronts her, and declares her immortality. She tells Lara they are the same and that Lara has killed too. Lara frees herself from Natla clutches and fights her. After depleting Natla\u2019s health, Lara avoids one last attack before knocking a column onto Natla, pinning her to the ground. Natla screams out in pain as the entire island begins to fall apart. Lara finds an escape and reaches the ocean. She finds Natla\u2019s boat along the shore and leaves the island behind her, remorseful for the choices she made but relieved that she was able to stop Natla, and save mankind.<\/p><h3>Main Characters<\/h3><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-195\" href=\"\/lara-croft\/3005-195\/\">Lara Croft<\/a><\/li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-2954\" href=\"\/jacqueline-natla\/3005-2954\/\">Jacqueline Natla<\/a><\/li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-2955\" href=\"\/larson\/3005-2955\/\">Larson Conway<\/a><\/li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-2956\" href=\"\/pierre-dupont\/3005-2956\/\">Pierre DuPont<\/a><\/li><\/ul><h3>Secondary Characters<\/h3><ul><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-18790\" href=\"\/jerome-johnson\/3005-18790\/\">Jerome \"The Kid\" Johnson<\/a><\/li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-23827\" href=\"\/kold-kin-kade\/3005-23827\/\">Kold Kin Kade<\/a><\/li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-11326\" href=\"\/qualopec\/3005-11326\/\">Qualopec<\/a><\/li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-11325\" href=\"\/tihocan\/3005-11325\/\">Tihocan<\/a><\/li><li><a data-ref-id=\"3005-11293\" href=\"\/doppelganger\/3005-11293\/\">Doppelg\u00e4nger<\/a><\/li><\/ul><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>In Anniversary Lara has a large variety of moves that were absent in the first Tomb Raider or were moves that have been re-worked for Anniversary.<\/p><ul><li>Lara can climb, shimmy, jump, and grab onto the environment.<\/li><li>Lara grabs onto poles and swings between ledges or other poles.<\/li><li>Lara now has the ability to grapple onto objects as well as run alongside walls while attached to a fixed point.<\/li><li>Lara is able to climb up poles, and can perch herself atop them to cross pits.-Lara can swing from ropes and climb up or down them for the best angle.<\/li><\/ul><p>Combat is based on Legend\u2019s engine.

The Mayan legend holds that their 300-day calendar year included five extra missing days, days in which, according to legend, the portals opened. It is Lara's task to open the portal once again.<\/p><p>In Underworld, Lara Croft and the environment she explores look much better due to a new graphics engine, and the gameplay itself has been revamped. Interaction with the environment is of special note. If Lara's knees become muddy from crouching the rain will soon wash it away. Lara also pushes through foliage with her hands and leaves footprints in the ground, she is able to destroy parts of the environment, and the people and animals she kills remain where they died.<\/p><p>Other additions to this Tomb Raider installment include a new melee combat system and the ability to pick up objects even if they aren't integral to progress in the game.<\/p><p>Underworld was released on 18th November, 2008 by developer Crystal Dynamics and publisher Eidos Interactive, and was made available for PS2, PS3, PC, Xbox 360, Wii and Nintendo DS. A demo for Xbox Live Marketplace was released on October 28, 2008 at 1.3 GB along side a PC release of this demo days later. The Xbox 360 version features 6 hours of exclusive content in the form of two single-player DLC missions titled \"Beneath the Ashes\" and \"Lara's Shadow\".<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3419\/783139-tru5.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-783139\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 800px\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3419\/783139-tru5.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-783139\"><img alt=\"Lara Croft as she appears in Underworld\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3419\/783139-tru5.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3419\/783139-tru5.png 800w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3419\/783139-tru5.png 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3419\/783139-tru5.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>Lara Croft as she appears in Underworld<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><i>Tomb Raider: Underworld<\/i> is a different experience than most other <i>Tomb Raider<\/i> games because it is somewhat open-ended, giving you the chance to explore and granting the game a less linear feel. As in most <i>Tomb Raider<\/i> games, <i>Underworld<\/i> has secrets and items to collect, so you are going to have to play the game more than once going through multiple paths to find everything.<\/p><p>In terms of action, the shooting has been revamped, so that Lara can shoot at two enemies at one time when using her pistols. It has also been noted that combat has been toned down to emphasize the adventure aspect of the game. There are no \"boss battles\" per se in Tomb Raider: Underworld, only larger enemies and challenges.<\/p><p>One of the key developments in gameplay has been the \"giant puzzle\" feature which shows the level itself acting as one continuous puzzle for Lara to solve. Developers have mentioned that a big part of the game is watching the level change around you as you solve the puzzles. Instead of a series of puzzles in succession, levels in Underworld are designed to be a mesh of puzzles fitting into a much larger idea than was at first apparent... which comes out in terms of gameplay as a series of puzzles in succession anyway.<\/p><h2>Plot<\/h2><p><i>Tomb Raider: Underworld<\/i> is a direct sequel to the previous Crystal Dynamics games <a href=\"\/lara-croft-tomb-raider-legend\/3030-8554\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8554\"><i>Tomb Raider: Legend<\/i><\/a>. As the game opens, Lara is making her way through a flaming Croft Manor. As Lara pushes her way through explosions and makes her way to safety, she finds her butler, <a href=\"\/winston-smith\/3005-2957\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2957\">Winston<\/a> helping her technical advisor <a href=\"\/zip\/3005-2960\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2960\">Zip<\/a> who is injured. Zip attempts to shoot Lara with Winston trying to hold him back. With that the game returns to one week in the past and we see Lara on her private boat in the Mediterranean sea, searching for the mystical burial place of King Arthur, named Avalon. Lara is looking for Avalon because <a href=\"\/amanda-evert\/3005-2962\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2962\">Amanda Evert<\/a>, one of Lara's many attractive female nemeses, explained that <a href=\"\/amelia-croft\/3005-2961\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2961\">Amelia Croft<\/a>, Lara's mother, had been transported to Avalon after pulling a sword from a stone in Nepal.<\/p><p>Upon finding a temple of 'Proto-Norse' origin, Lara comes to believe that due to the similarities between the English myth of Avalon and the Norse myth of Niflheim being so strong (in reality, the myths have almost nothing in common), that they are merely different cultures interpretations of the same place. Upon further searching the temple under the sea, she finds a gauntlet, supposedly that which the Norse god Thor worn. However, Lara is knocked out by a team of mercenaries under Amanda's hire and abandoned to die in the temple. Lara however, chases down the mercenaries to their ship and climbs aboard where she finds Amanda speaking with another enemy of Lara's; <a href=\"\/jacqueline-natla\/3005-2954\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2954\">Jacqueline Natla<\/a>, who is held captive. As Lara listens to them talk, she learns that Avalon is in fact the same as Helheim the Norse <a href=\"\/hell\/3035-24\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-24\">Hell<\/a>, rather than Niflheim, and that no-one will be able to enter Helheim without Mj\u00f6llnir; Thor's Hammer. Due to an explosion caused by Lara fighting a mercenary, the ship begins to sink. As Lara escapes, she sees Amanda fleeing and shoots at her. Amanda throws the gauntlet into the water and Lara dives in after it, losing Amanda, but saving the god's gauntlet.<\/p><p>After inexplicably making her way to coastal <a href=\"\/thailand\/3035-30\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-30\">Thailand<\/a>, Lara learns that her late father, Richard Croft had already done extensive studying on the subject of Helheim and had gotten to the second gauntlet years ago, hiding it in a disguised crypt beneath Croft Manor. Finding the gauntlet (as well as a map to Thor's belt) Lara returns to the surface to find her mansion in flames. Lara makes her way through Croft manor only to be shot at by Zip who explains that Lara shot him and stole Amanda's 'Wraith Stone' from a vault. Lara and Winston explain to Zip that it wasn't Lara who shot Zip, asserting that Lara would have no need to burn down her own mansion and as Lara tells Winston and Zip to get out of the building, she herself goes to check the security feed in the computer room. Upon reaching the computer room, Lara catches a glance at her reflection in the glass wall, noting it looks somehow different. Suddenly, Lara understands that she isn't looking at her reflection, but a perfect doppelg\u00e4nger of herself on the other side of the glass. As Lara and the doppelg\u00e4nger fight, <a href=\"\/alister-fletcher\/3005-2963\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2963\">Alister<\/a> makes his way into the room, trying to escape the flames, but is shot by the doppelg\u00e4nger. Lara attempts to shoot her copy, but she escapes too quickly. Carrying Alister out of the burning manor, it is determined that he is dead and Lara stands, more determined than ever to find Mj\u00f6llnir, stating that she needs Thor's hammer to kill a god; Natla.<\/p><p>Making her way to Mexico, Lara finds Thor's belt and as she puts it on, Thor's gauntlets power up, giving her the ability to handle Mj\u00f6llnir as soon as she finds it. She makes her way to Jan Mayen Island, finally finding Mj\u00f6llnir, where she also finds a message from Thor's father Odin, explaining a ritual needs to be undertaken in order to open the gates to Helheim.<\/p><p>With Thor's belt, hammer and gauntlets Lara makes her way to the sister ship of the vessel she sank earlier, where Amanda is once again holding Natla. Murdering all the guards on the ship with Mj\u00f6llnir, Lara confronts Natla. Soon after, Amanda and the doppelg\u00e4nger appear, but the doppelg\u00e4nger throws Amanda down a shaft. Natla claims to know the ritual that will open Helheim and agrees to help a wary Lara who proclaims that when Natla makes a wrong move, Lara will kill her. With the help of Natla, Lara opens the gateway to Helheim, deep beneath the Arctic Sea. Eventually, Lara finds Amelia, her mother who has been turned into a thrall, a deceased person or creature that continuously reanimates due to a substance called eitir. Lacking any mind, memory or real conciousness to speak of, Amelia approaches Lara, but Lara coldly and mercilessly guns her down, saying that she was not her mother, and that her mother died a long time ago. After Amelia's death, Natla makes the ridiculous claim that everything up to that point had been orchestrated by Natla to allow her access to Avalon, though it had already been stated that this was not Avalon. She also explains that her first attempt failed years ago when Richard Croft, Lara's father, refused to help her, so Natla killed him.<\/p><p>As Lara goes to strike Natla with Mj\u00f6llnir, the doppelg\u00e4nger appears and restrains Lara. Natla leaves Lara to the doppelg\u00e4nger, who attempts to kill Lara, but is suddenly disabled by Amanda, who of course wasn't really dead. Amanda realises that the world is in danger and holds off a number of incoming thralls so that Lara can defeat Natla.<\/p><p>When Lara reaches Natla, she is operating a titanic device called the Midguard Serpent, which is designed to bring about the Seventh Age, triggering apocalyptic levels of volcanic activity throughout the world. As Lara steadily destroys the device with Mj\u00f6llnir, Natla tries to stop her, but to no avail. With the destruction of the Midgard Serpent imminent, Lara hurls the hammer at Natla which strikes her and sends her hurtling down into a sea of etir.<\/p><p>As Lara regroups with Amanda, they find the exit is blocked and that there is no discernible way out. Lara, however finds a sword like Excalibur embedded in a rock, next to a portal identical to the one that transported Amelia to Helheim in the first place and determines that if they were to pull the sword out, they would be returned to Nepal. However, the portal is broken and Lara determines that the only way for them both to escape is for Lara to hold the Portal steady and for Amanda to pull the sword, with the two of them touching hands at the last moment to both be transported.<\/p><p>As Lara and Amanda find themselves in Nepal, they state that they are even. As Amanda leaves, Lara says goodbye to her mother, walking away from the portal as the game ends.<\/p><h2>Controversy<\/h2><p>Shortly before the release of the game, a representative of the Eidos PR company Barrington Harvey caused outrage when he made several comments referring to review scores of Tomb Raider: Underworld.<\/p><p>The news broke when a GameSpot UK employee left a Twitter post explaining that Eidos had asserted that any reviews of the game with a score lower than eight out of ten were not to be posted online or in print until after Monday, November 24th. When a journalist for Videogaming247 called Barrington Harvery, they shockingly received an honest answer: an employee acknowledged the review ban and admitted that Eidos was attempting to manage reviews in order to make the game's Metacritic rating higher and not put people off buying the game.<\/p><p>At the time, OXM UK and Eurogamer had each put up their reviews of the game, both of which stood at 7.0, an act which the representative asserted had caused problems. The Metacritic score stood at 78 and has since dropped to 77.<\/p><p>Although the act of managing review scores is not particularly uncommon in the games industry, it is particularly rare for a representative of such a firm to admit to it as the role of managing review scores is seen by all as dishonest. The news spelled bad news for Eidos who had previously been accused of pulling strings to get <a href=\"\/jeff-gerstmann\/3040-89712\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-89712\">Jeff Gerstmann<\/a> fired from his job at GameSpot over a 6\/10 review of their game <a href=\"\/kane-lynch-dead-men\/3030-19874\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19874\"><i>Kane and Lynch: Dead Men<\/i><\/a>.<\/p><h2>Release<\/h2><p>In the UK, Game stores offered a Limited Edition copy of the game for the same price as the standard edition. Exclusive to this release is a special bonus DVD which includes \"Exclusive Behind the Scenes Documentary,\" \"Previously Unreleased In-Game Music,\" \"Art Gallery,\" \"Video\" and \"Trailers\" all bought together with the standard game disc in a cardboard packaging.<\/p><h3>Critical Reaction<\/h3><p>Although Tomb Raider: Underworld has received mostly positive results from critics, it has prompted suffered a few criticisms.<\/p><p><b>GameSpot<\/b> offered a 7\/10 review of the game, noting \"<i>Excellent mix of outdoor, underground, and underwater locations<\/i>,\" but pointing out that \"<i>it does little to address previous games' problems<\/i>,\" which the full review specifies as camera problems, bad dialogue, and a lack of refinement to core gameplay.<\/p><p><b>IGN<\/b> went on to point out further flaws, such as object detection and combat issues, although still gave the game no lower than a 7.4\/10 for the PS3.<\/p><p><b>Nintendo Power<\/b> gave the Nintendo Wii version of the game a 7\/10, citing the game's environments as the best in the series, but pointing out easy puzzles as a cause for concern. Combat was also described as \"so obsolete that the developers needn't have bothered.\"<\/p><p>The game has however marveled some reviewers who have produced wildly enthusiastic reviews.<\/p><p>The United Kingdom phone network, <b>Orange<\/b>, produced a review of the game scoring the game at 9\/10, praising the environments and Lara's reactions to them. The diminished amount of combat was noted as a positive change, claiming the main appeal was in the exploration of the worlds which come to life.<\/p><p>Although <b>The Guardian<\/b> newspaper noted that the camera had a tendency to go haywire, they still gave it a 4\/5 review pointing out the graphics and story (going so far to refer to them as \"unimpeachable\") and stating that fans of the series will \"<i>certainly agree that it's the best<\/i> Tomb Raider <i>game yet.<\/i>\"<\/p><p><b>Gamesradar<\/b> also went on to give the game a 9\/10 review, mentioning that although Lara's tendency to \"<i>[freak] out and [jump] off in the wrong direction<\/i>\" happens far too often, that exemplary check-pointing and the decision to ditch boss battles pays off.<\/p><p>As of December 6th, 2010, the platform-specific rankings for each version of the game on Metacritic are as follows:<\/p><ul><li><b>Xbox 360<\/b>: 76\/100<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Nintendo Wii<\/b>: 70\/100<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Microsoft Windows<\/b>: 80\/100<\/li><\/ul><ul><li><b>Playstation 3<\/b>: 75\/100<\/li><\/ul><h2>Downloadable Content<\/h2><p>Eidos released two new chapters of Tomb Raider: Underworld as DLC for the Xbox 360 only due to an arrangement with Microsoft. Eidos did not announce any prices for the new chapters, but offered release dates. The first chapter, titled \"Beneath the Ashes,\" was stated to be released Christmas 2008, but never arrived. The second one, \"Lara's Shadow,\" was released March 10th, 2009.<\/p><h3>Lara's Shadow<\/h3><p>Lara\u2019s Shadow allows gamers to experience Lara\u2019s universe from an entirely new perspective: that of her evil doppelg\u00e4nger. With faster movement, shadow powers, and a melee attack that decimates enemies with devastating accuracy and speed, the doppelg\u00e4nger opens up new gameplay mechanics, areas and puzzles that wouldn\u2019t be possible while playing as regular ol' Lara. Lara\u2019s Shadow is available for 800 Microsoft Points.<\/p><p>When it was later confirmed by a reporter for MTV Multiplayer that there are no plans to produce the two new chapters for PS3 or PC, a outcry from the fans followed. An Eidos spokesperson gave a defending statement for the move: <i>\"<\/i>Microsoft asked us how we could extend the fantastic Tomb Raider: Underworld gameplay experience for their thriving Xbox Live community and this exclusive content was the result.\"<\/p><p>On November 8th a jury and public vote took place on the Festival Arcadia's <i>Virtually Fashionable<\/i> to determine which of a number of new outfits would be made available to download over Xbox Live Marketplace. The two winning designs, produced by Qu\u00e9bec fashion designers are to be made available at a later date.<\/p><p>Four additional costumes for Lara are available for free on the Xbox Live Marketplace. The costumes are two classic Lara Croft outfits and two types of form-fitting wetsuits.<\/p><h2>PC System Requirements<\/h2><h3>Minimum Settings<\/h3><ul><li><ul><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> XP (admin

It is a full reboot of the <a href=\"\/tomb-raider\/3025-267\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-267\">Tomb Raider<\/a> franchise; the game's story, written by <a href=\"\/rhianna-pratchett\/3040-42646\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-42646\">Rhianna Pratchett<\/a> and <a href=\"\/susan-oconnor\/3040-74356\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-74356\">Susan O'Connor,<\/a> tells the tale of a young and inexperienced Lara Croft's first adventure. The game was developed by 80% of the team that worked on previous Lara Croft games and features a brand new engine dubbed the Crystal Engine.<\/p><p>Tomb Raider's development was first announced by publisher <a href=\"\/square-enix\/3010-104\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-104\">Square Enix <\/a>on December 6, 2010. Initially scheduled for Fall 2012, release was pushed after Crystal Dynamics received a directive from Square Enix President <a href=\"\/youichi-wada\/3040-48566\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-48566\">Yoichi Wada <\/a>to make the best game that they could possibly make. It was finally released on March 5, 2013 to general acclaim.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>Like its <a href=\"\/tomb-raider\/3025-267\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-267\">precursors<\/a>, the new Tomb Raider involves a mix of puzzle solving, platforming and combat in an open world environment. In terms of tone and mechanics, however, the game is more serious and realistic <b>\u2013 <\/b>Lara does not dive in slow motion while using dual pistols with pinpoint lock-on accuracy, but rather <a href=\"\/cover-system\/3015-55\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-55\">takes cover<\/a> behind the environment and eliminates enemies with a carefully aimed arrow from her bow. Unlike the typical franchise enemy roster, consisting largely of various wild animals, players' opponents in this game are almost universally human, with few exceptions. This decreased diversity is offset by an increased depth to the combat. Lara uses four different ranged weapons, each with its own unlockable upgrades, <a href=\"\/alternate-fire\/3015-593\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-593\">alt-fire mode<\/a>, and out-of-combat utility. Upgrading weapons requires resources in the form of salvage which can be found in various containers throughout the island or by looting corpses. She can also use salvage to unlock limited close-combat capabilities, being able to dodge and counterattack, as well as perform executions on incapacitated enemies.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2458291\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/130213\/2458291-2453624-203160_2013-03-10_00036.png\" data-ratio=\"0.6062925170068\" data-width=\"1176\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1176px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.6%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/130213\/2458291-2453624-203160_2013-03-10_00036.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2458291\"><img alt=\"Action-packed sequences abound.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/130213\/2458291-2453624-203160_2013-03-10_00036.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/130213\/2458291-2453624-203160_2013-03-10_00036.png 1176w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/13\/130213\/2458291-2453624-203160_2013-03-10_00036.png 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/13\/130213\/2458291-2453624-203160_2013-03-10_00036.png 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/130213\/2458291-2453624-203160_2013-03-10_00036.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>Action-packed sequences abound.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Tomb Raider's platforming follows in the vein of the <a href=\"\/uncharted\/3025-957\/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-957\">Uncharted <\/a>series, with cinematic set-pieces and dynamic features, as well as limited use of <a href=\"\/quick-time-event\/3015-6\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6\">quick-time events<\/a>. These set-pieces led to some initial negative publicity for the game (the first in the franchise to receive an 'M' ESRB rating), as failure frequently results in gruesome, fully-animated deaths, such as being impaled through the chin or crushed under a boulder. Increased control over jumps and the ability to scramble up walls, among other enhancements, make the platforming feel more polished mechanically than previously in the franchise. Puzzle-solving is also a more active process, as Lara must take into account variable elements such as fire, wind, and momentum. To aid her, Lara can activate her \"<a href=\"\/detective-mode\/3015-6244\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6244\">Survival Instinct<\/a>\" at any time while standing still, which will highlight objectives, enemies, collectibles, and interactive elements.<\/p><p>Base Camps allow Lara to <a href=\"\/fast-travel\/3015-676\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-676\">fast travel<\/a> across the island. These camps are also where the player upgrades Lara's skills and weapons. Use of fast travel is essential for getting all the <a href=\"\/collectibles\/3015-375\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-375\">collectibles<\/a>, as many are hidden or blocked behind obstacles that Lara obtains the tools to overcome later in the game. These collectibles include journals from past island inhabitants and the Endurance crew, relics reflecting the island's legacy, and GPS markers which reveal hidden caches. They can be found through exploration, by use of Survival Instinct, or by clearing each area's tomb to retrieve the treasure map at the end.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2603725\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/18\/189230\/2603725-2013-05-13_00006.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/18\/189230\/2603725-2013-05-13_00006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2603725\"><img alt=\"Don't look down.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/18\/189230\/2603725-2013-05-13_00006.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/18\/189230\/2603725-2013-05-13_00006.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/18\/189230\/2603725-2013-05-13_00006.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/18\/189230\/2603725-2013-05-13_00006.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Don't look down.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/18\/189230\/2603725-2013-05-13_00006.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/18\/189230\/2603725-2013-05-13_00006.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/18\/189230\/2603725-2013-05-13_00006.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/18\/189230\/2603725-2013-05-13_00006.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Don't look down.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Travelling aboard the <em>Endurance<\/em>, Lara and her boss, archaeologist <a href=\"\/dr-james-jim-whitman\/3005-25670\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-25670\">Dr. James Whitman<\/a>, are seeking the ruins of the legendary island of Yamatai, which was ruled by the shamanistic Sun Queen, Himiko.

For Lara, the quest is inherited from her father, also an archaeologist, while for Dr. Whitman the primary appeal is as material for a TV series. Against Dr. Whitman's wishes, they follow Lara's hunch that Yamatai is to be found in the Dragon's Triangle, an infamously stormy and dangerous area of the ocean southeast of Japan. The Endurance is caught in a raging squall and shipwrecked on a mysterious island. The survivors soon encounter a band of homicidal madmen, and are split up in the ensuing melee. Most of the game focuses on Lara's journeys across the island to reunite with and rescue her friends, and find a way home. Early on, she manages to send an SOS message, and a plane arrives to evacuate the survivors. However, a freak localized storm forms and strikes the plane from the sky.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2458801\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/130213\/2458801-2453469-203160_2013-03-09_00011.png\" data-ratio=\"0.64360587002096\" data-width=\"954\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 954px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:64.4%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/130213\/2458801-2453469-203160_2013-03-09_00011.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2458801\"><img alt=\"Trial by fire.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/13\/130213\/2458801-2453469-203160_2013-03-09_00011.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/130213\/2458801-2453469-203160_2013-03-09_00011.png 954w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/13\/130213\/2458801-2453469-203160_2013-03-09_00011.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Trial by fire.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/13\/130213\/2458801-2453469-203160_2013-03-09_00011.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/130213\/2458801-2453469-203160_2013-03-09_00011.png 954w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/13\/130213\/2458801-2453469-203160_2013-03-09_00011.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Trial by fire.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>As she fights the hostile inhabitants of Yamatai it is revealed that they are a fanatical cult led by the ruthless and insane <a href=\"\/father-mathias\/3005-25906\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-25906\">Father Mathias<\/a>, who was stranded there in 1982. As more people are shipwrecked by the Dragon Triangle's storms, the men are captured, tortured, and indoctrinated into the Solarii, the warrior core of the cult. The women, however, can be found crucified and burned to death across the island in some twisted ritual. Lara eventually reunites with most of her companions, including Joslin Reyes, the mechanic, who is repairing an escape boat, but discovers that Samantha has been abducted by Mathias for a sinister purpose. Pursuing him into the island's ancient temple, Lara discovers that the storms that surround Yamatai are caused by Himiko's vengeful spirit, still trapped in her ancient corpse. Mathias believes if they offer Himiko a \"living successor\", she'll stop the storms and allow them to escape. However, the ritual for the transferal of power involves a trial by fire, which every woman thus far has failed. Samantha miraculously survives the trial, and Mathias takes her into the inner sanctum to continue the ritual. This angers the Guardians, magically preserved but mindless soldiers of Yamatai who defend Himiko's remains. Lara fights her way through both Solarii and Guardians to finally reach Mathias and Samantha in the midst of the transference process. There, Lara finally learns the secret that Mathias knew but she didn't. Namely, that Himiko was a sorceress who cheated death by stealing the bodies of young women as she grew old again and again; the last 'successor to the throne' learned of this ahead of time and poisoned herself during the ritual, so that Himiko's evil soul was trapped in the girl's dead body. Mathias intends to sacrifice Sam to Himiko, giving Himiko the living Sam's body, killing Sam in the process. Therefore, to save her friend, Lara kills Mathias (finally wielding her trademark dual pistols) and torches Himiko's body, sending the witch-queen to Hell once and for all.<\/p><p>With the storms finally eliminated, Lara and Samantha escape with what few companions survive (only Reyes and Jonah, the galley master). They are picked up by a passing ship, and given the opportunity to go back home. However, traumatized by her experiences, Lara now believes that she is an adventurer at heart, and there are many more questions that need answering. She has become a survivor, and will go wherever she must to find answers.<\/p>","expected_release_day":null,"expected_release_month":null,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":null,"guid":"3030-27312","id":27312,"image":{"icon_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/2351232-tomb_raider.jpg","medium_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/2351232-tomb_raider.jpg","screen_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/2351232-tomb_raider.jpg","screen_large_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/screen_kubrick\/2351232-tomb_raider.jpg","small_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/2351232-tomb_raider.jpg","super_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/2351232-tomb_raider.jpg","thumb_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/2351232-tomb_raider.jpg","tiny_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/2351232-tomb_raider.jpg","original_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/2351232-tomb_raider.jpg","image_tags":"All
