This port includes an updated level design, including a brand new outdoor prologue segment.

This version was also included in the Metal Gear Solid 3 part of <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-hd-collection\/3030-35508\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-35508\">Metal Gear Solid HD Collection<\/a> for the <a href=\"\/xbox-360\/3045-20\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360<\/a> and <a href=\"\/playstation-3\/3045-35\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PlayStation 3<\/a>.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>Metal Gear is considered to be one of the very first <a href=\"\/stealth\/3015-24\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-24\">stealth<\/a> games, and the gameplay reflects that. The game was played from a <a href=\"\/top-down-perspective\/3015-788\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-788\">top down perspective<\/a> where the player had direct control over Snake. The emphasis of the game was on moving through the environment without being detected by the enemies rather than focusing on combat. This is reflected in the weapons that Snake uses, which tend to be <a href=\"\/silencer\/3055-489\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-489\">silenced<\/a>, and are used to clear obstacles such as hollow walls or electrified floors. The only time that the player is forced to fight enemies is if they are spotted, or in order to defeat the game's <a href=\"\/bosses\/3015-229\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-229\">bosses<\/a>.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/276\/667896-metal_gear_07.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-667896\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.88235294117647\" data-width=\"544\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 544px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:88.2%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/276\/667896-metal_gear_07.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-667896\"><img alt=\"Binoculars work in an interesting way.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/276\/667896-metal_gear_07.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/276\/667896-metal_gear_07.png 544w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/276\/667896-metal_gear_07.png 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/276\/667896-metal_gear_07.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>Binoculars work in an interesting way.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The player can also pick up and interact with objects in the levels. This comes in the form of obtaining <a href=\"\/ammunition\/3015-3761\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3761\">ammunition<\/a> or rations from defeated enemies, and colored <a href=\"..\/..\/color-coded-key\/93-233\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">key cards<\/a> used to open locked doors. The game also has a <a href=\"\/leveling-up\/3015-475\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-475\">level system<\/a>, where if Snake rescues <a href=\"\/hostages\/3015-367\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-367\">hostages<\/a>, he gains a rank, which increases his maximum health, and carry capacity. For every 5 hostages the play rescues, they gain a rank, but they will lose a level if they allow a hostage to die.<\/p><p>Metal Gear is also known for pioneering the concept of an ' <a href=\"..\/..\/alert\/92-1606\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alert Mode<\/a>'. When the player is spotted, the game switches to Alert Mode, where the player must try to escape or kill those that have seen them. If the player is seen and a single <a href=\"\/exclamation-mark\/3015-818\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-818\">!<\/a> appears <a href=\"..\/..\/punctuation-mark-over-the-head\/92-4035\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">above the enemies head<\/a>, then the game enters into a level 1 alert. In this mode, the player can escape the alert by simply moving to a different screen, or by killing the enemies in that screen. However if the player is spotted and two !! appear over an enemies head, then the game enters into a level 2 alert and not only will enemies in the screen attack the player, but off screen reinforcements will attack as well. In this mode, simply moving to an adjacent screen will not suffice; they can only end the alert by killing all incoming enemies, or by leaving the building they are in and going outside, or by moving up or down a floor in the building.<\/p><h2>Version Differences<\/h2><p>This game was originally released on the <a href=\"\/msx\/3045-15\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-15\">MSX2<\/a>, and this original version has fairly significant differences to the <a href=\"\/nes\/3045-21\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-21\">NES<\/a> release. The NES release was produced without any involvement from series creator <a href=\"\/hideo-kojima\/3040-63395\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-63395\">Hideo Kojima<\/a>. Kojima has openly said that he is unhappy with the Metal Gear released on the NES in the US and has said it is \"complete garbage\". The game was also released on the <a href=\"\/commodore-64\/3045-14\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-14\">Commodore 64<\/a> and the <a href=\"\/pc\/3045-94\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC<\/a> in the early 1990s. These versions were based on the NES version, rather than the MSX2 original.<\/p><h3>Specific Differences (in the NES version from the MSX)<\/h3><ul><li>The starting area in the NES version features a jungle instead of swimming directly into Building 1 like in the MSX version.<\/li><li>A lot of the music has been changed in the NES version including: Battle Theme, Intro, and Main Themes. Also, even some of the themes that were not completely changed were altered in some way (sped up or slowed down).<\/li><li>Basement layouts were changed or switched around.<\/li><li>Schneider's frequency was changed to 120.26 from 120.16.<\/li><li>The parachute was removed and replaced by the iron glove (which is considered by many to be useless).<\/li><li>The rocket rangers on the rooftop of building 1 and 2 do not have the ability to fly.<\/li><li>The hind D boss battle was removed and replaced by a pair of snipers - twin shot.<\/li><li>The trucks in the NES version are usually facing south instead of north.<\/li><li>The most notable difference is that players no longer fight Metal Gear at the end, but instead destroy a supercomputer which controls Metal Gears functions.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Story<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/276\/667914-metal_gear_17.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-667914\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.88235294117647\" data-width=\"544\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 544px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:88.2%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/276\/667914-metal_gear_17.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-667914\"><img alt=\"The game is shown from a top-down perspective.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/276\/667914-metal_gear_17.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/276\/667914-metal_gear_17.png 544w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/276\/667914-metal_gear_17.png 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/276\/667914-metal_gear_17.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The game is shown from a top-down perspective.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/276\/667914-metal_gear_17.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/276\/667914-metal_gear_17.png 544w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/276\/667914-metal_gear_17.png 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/276\/667914-metal_gear_17.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The game is shown from a top-down perspective.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Set in 1995, Metal Gear takes place after the event of <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater\/3030-18082\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18082\">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater<\/a>, <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-portable-ops\/3030-14555\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14555\">Portable Ops<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-peace-walker\/3030-26817\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26817\">Peace Walker<\/a>, and before the events of <a href=\"\/metal-gear-2-solid-snake\/3030-723\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-723\">Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake<\/a>. The player controls a rookie soldier codenamed <a href=\"\/solid-snake\/3005-75\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-75\">\"Solid Snake\"<\/a>, the newest <a href=\"\/foxhound\/3015-447\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-447\">FOXHOUND<\/a> Member. Snake's mission is to infiltrate <a href=\"\/outer-heaven\/3035-330\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-330\">Outer Heaven<\/a>, and militaristic state founded by a \" <a href=\"\/big-boss\/3005-475\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-475\">legendary mercenary<\/a>\". The objective is to sneak in and destroy <a href=\"\/metal-gear\/3055-28\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-28\">Metal Gear<\/a>, a new and mysterious weapon of mass destruction being constructed deep within Outer Heaven.<\/p><p>In response to this threat, FOXHOUND sends one of their top agents <a href=\"\/gray-fox\/3005-901\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-901\">Gray Fox<\/a> to infiltrate Outer Haven and assess the situation, and deal with the threat posed by Metal Gear. However, after a few days, contact with him was lost, and the last message he sent was a mysterious transmission that simply read: \"METAL GEAR...\". The leader of FOXHOUND, <a href=\"\/big-boss\/3005-475\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-475\">Big Boss<\/a>, sends in Solid Snake to rescue Gray Fox, and complete Gray Fox's original objective, \"Operation: Intrude N313\"<\/p><p>When Snake arrives in Outer Heaven, he meets local resistance members Kyle Schneider, Diane, and Jennifer, who agree to help him on his mission. Solid Snake begins his mission, and with his skills, and only using equipment procured on his mission, he manages to rescue Gray Fox. Upon rescuing him, Snake learns that Metal Gear is the codename for a walking bipedal tank armed with nuclear weapons. Outer Heaven plans to use this mobile nuclear platform to dominate the world, and install itself as the new world superpower.<\/p><p>In order to learn how to stop Metal Gear, Snake seeks out and rescues Dr. Drago Pettrovich, the lead engineer of Metal Gear, as well as his daughter Ellen. Dr. Pettrovich informs Snake how to destroy Metal Gear. Armed with this knowledge Snake sneaks and fights his way through Outer Heaven to get to Metal Gear. However, Snake begins to notice that the enemy is able to track his movements with uncanny precision, and he wonders how he is being tracked so accurately.<\/p><p>Never the less, Snake is able to make his way to the core of the base where Metal Gear is housed, and is able to neutralize it before it is completed. Having completed his mission, Snake begins his escape from the complex, however on his way out he is confronted by Big Boss who reveals himself to be the \"legendary mercenary\" and leader of Outer Heaven. He explains to Snake that he used his position as leader of FOXHOUND to steal military intelligence and build up his own mercenary forces, which are culminated as Outer Heaven, and the Metal Gear program. He had expected Snake to fail in his mission, since he was still just a rookie, and when he did not, he began to inform his soldiers of Snake's position, which explained why Snake was being tracked so precisely. Big Boss then starts a self-destruct sequence for the compound, stating that he won't die alone, and that Solid Snake will come with him. After a desperate battle, Snake manages to defeat Big Boss and make his escape of the compound; fleeing the base as it explodes behind him. However, after the credits of the gameplay, a message from Big Boss is displayed, saying that he will meet Snake again.<\/p><h2>Trivia<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\"

It is the sequel to the 1987 <a href=\"\/metal-gear\/3030-6712\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6712\">Metal Gear<\/a>, enhancing the stealth mechanics (including a more realistic field-of-vision for enemies and <a href=\"\/prone\/3015-622\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-622\">prone<\/a> movement).<\/p><p>Set in 1999, four years after a rookie operative of the United States special forces unit <a href=\"\/foxhound\/3015-447\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-447\">FOXHOUND<\/a> (codenamed <a href=\"\/solid-snake\/3005-75\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-75\">\"Solid Snake\"<\/a>) infiltrated the fortified compound <a href=\"\/outer-heaven\/3035-330\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-330\">Outer Heaven<\/a> and destroyed a bi-pedal nuclear-armed tank known as <a href=\"\/metal-gear\/3055-28\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-28\">Metal Gear<\/a>, the game has players reprising the role of Snake, who is brought out of retirement by new FOXHOUND commander <a href=\"\/colonel-campbell\/3005-839\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-839\">Roy Campbell<\/a> to infiltrate the fortified state of <a href=\"\/zanzibar-land\/3035-240\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-240\">Zanzibar Land<\/a>, rescue Czech scientist <a href=\"\/kio-marv\/3005-21140\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-21140\">Dr. Kio Marv<\/a> (who has engineered a genetically-modified oil-producing microbe, called OILIX, to solve a global fuel crisis), and destroy the successor to the original Metal Gear: <a href=\"\/metal-gear-d\/3055-4792\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-4792\">Metal Gear D<\/a>.<\/p><p>A modified version of the game was later released for mobile phones in Japan on October 1, 2004, revamping the character designs, adding new game modes, and modifying items and gameplay mechanics. Another modified version was later released in 2006 for the <a href=\"\/playstation-2\/3045-19\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-19\">PlayStation 2<\/a> (alongside the original Metal Gear) as part of <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-3-subsistence\/3030-10267\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10267\">Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence<\/a>, which was later used for the 2011 <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-hd-collection\/3030-35508\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-35508\">Metal Gear Solid HD Collection<\/a> for the <a href=\"\/xbox-360\/3045-20\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360<\/a>, <a href=\"\/playstation-3\/3045-35\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PlayStation 3<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/playstation-vita\/3045-129\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-129\">PlayStation Vita<\/a>. This version was the first to be released internationally, including official English translation.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>The gameplay of Metal Gear 2 continues on the foundation built by Metal Gear, but with many new additions that add greater depth to the stealth gameplay of its predecessor. For example, guards now gained a 45 degree field of vision which makes stealth gameplay of higher importance. Previously in the original, enemies could only see in straight lines, making for moments where the player could simply sneak by the guards by not walking on the same horizontal or vertical sight line. Guards also do not stay static to one screen and can maneuver onto adjacent screens, making the radar very important. The alert system was also overhauled, as escaping onto another screen did not eliminate the alert phase and required players to truly hide instead of merely moving away from the trouble. Radio conversations were now dynamic, the in-game contacts was raised from four to eight, the Solition radar system which displayed enemy units and key units on a 3x3 grid, and the ability to crawl were all newly implemented features.<\/p><p>Gameplay revolves around non-lethal action and staying hidden. Like the original, the game starts Solid Snake off with no weapons and a pack of cigarettes and leaves the rest in terms of weaponry to be procured later. As such, gameplay is highly a challenge of wits, monitoring unit formations and patterns then moving at the right time to avoid detection.<\/p><p>Despite the transition to 3D, the gameplay of its popular sequel <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid\/3030-16140\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16140\">Metal Gear Solid<\/a> would remain largely identical to the gameplay of Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, with Metal Gear Solid even borrowing many of the same set-pieces, boss fights, plot elements and puzzles used in this game.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><p>In the year 1999, rising oil prices have caused the world to look for alternative means of energy in an earth that has successfully thawed through the Cold War. With oil reserves slowly being depleted, one Czech scientist, <a href=\"\/kio-marv\/3005-21140\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-21140\">Dr. Kio Marv<\/a>, has found the miracle cure to the oil problem in the form of biologically developed algae he dubbed OILIX. This algae had the remarkable ability to produce petroleum-grade hydrocarbons with little expense and effort. Following his demonstration at the World Energy Conference in his home state of Prague, Czech Republic, Marv is kidnapped on his way to the United States by soldiers from <a href=\"\/zanzibar-land\/3035-240\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-240\">Zanzibar Land<\/a>. Leaders from Zanzibar Land hold the world hostage as it is revealed that the nation had a stockpile of nuclear weapons. Solid Snake, now having gone into retirement after the events of the original Metal Gear, is called out of retirement and returns to <a href=\"\/foxhound\/3015-447\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-447\">FOXHOUND<\/a> under the leadership of Colonel <a href=\"\/colonel-campbell\/3005-839\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-839\">Roy Campbell<\/a>. Commencing Operation F014, Snake is again sent in with no weapons and his pack of <a href=\"\/cigarette\/3055-311\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-311\">cigarettes<\/a> to rescue Dr. Marv.<\/p><p>Initially working his way through the outside of Zanzibar Land, Snake is contacted by <a href=\"\/holly-white\/3005-21135\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-21135\">Holly White<\/a>, an undercover CIA agent posing as a journalist who gives him tips on navigating the complex. Snake is also aided by George Kessler, an expert in mercenary knowledge and informing Snake of each of the bosses and tips to overcome the boss, and <a href=\"\/master-miller\/3005-5186\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5186\">McDonell \"Master\" Miller<\/a>, who gives the player life advice and tips about flora and fauna. When Snake finds Dr. Marv, it is revealed that it is actually a disguised boss <a href=\"\/black-ninja\/3005-3869\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3869\">Black Ninja<\/a>, who is actually Kyle Schneider from Metal Gear. After his defeat, Schneider tells Snake where and how to find <a href=\"\/drago-pettrovich-madnar\/3005-18219\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-18219\">Dr. Madnar<\/a>, another character from Metal Gear who was captured along with Marv, and how to traverse through the jungle. When Snake deciphers the tap code by Madnar, Snake learns the leader of Zanzibar Land is none other than <a href=\"\/big-boss\/3005-475\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-475\">Big Boss<\/a>, who survived his confrontation at <a href=\"\/outer-heaven\/3035-330\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-330\">Outer Heaven<\/a>, and that Madnar is again developing a new Metal Gear project. Snake also receives messages from \"his number one fan\" who gives him tips on certain situations.<\/p><p>Despite being captured, Snake rescues Holly and finds a note on a carrier pigeon, giving him a radio frequency to contact Marv. Through codec conversations between Madnar and Master Miller, Snake deciphers the message and is tasked to find <a href=\"\/gustava-heffner\/3005-21136\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-21136\">Gustava Heffner<\/a>, an StB agent who is Marv's bodyguard. Snake finds Gustava, rescues Madnar, and sets out to find Marv on another part of the island. When crossing a bridge made for one person only, <a href=\"\/gray-fox\/3005-901\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-901\">Gray Fox<\/a>, piloting Metal Gear D, destroys the bridge and kills Gustava who was walking across the bridge. Gustava dies in Snake's arms, thanking him for recognizing her pre StB origin as an Olympic Figure Skater. Having to backtrack around for a new way to get across, Snake gets a hang glider and flies over, and later finds Marv dead in a room along with Madnar nearby. Holly messages Snake and informs him of Madnar's betrayal because of the scientific community's rejection of his theories. Now working voluntarily on Metal Gear, Madnar attempts to choke out Snake, but Snake easily dispatches him and recovers the <a href=\"\/msx\/3045-15\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-15\">MSX<\/a> cartridge with the OILIX formula.<\/p><p>In an act of absolution, Madnar reveals the secret to eliminating <a href=\"\/metal-gear-d\/3055-4792\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-4792\">Metal Gear D<\/a>, and Snake is promptly dropped via trapdoor into a chamber where the waiting Metal Gear sits, being piloted by Gray Fox. Using grenades, Snake is able to destroy Metal Gear D, but the ensuing explosion causes all of his equipment to catch fire. Down to his fists, Snake battles Gray Fox in a minefield in a battle of FOXHOUND's two greatest soldiers. Snake wins the battle and Fox reveals to him that he was the number one fan all along and relinquishes the title of Fox to him. Snake recaptures the OILIX cartridge, but is lead by a voice leading him to confront the very much alive Big Boss. For the second time in his life, Snake fights his former commanding officer and through smart use of raiding storage rooms is able to fashion a makeshift flamethrower through a lighter and an aerosol spray can. Snake incinerates Big Boss and definitively kills him for good. With his objective complete, he and Holly find each other and begin to make their escape despite hoards of enemy troops following them. Just when it seems that the two are caught in a dead end and being surrounded by enemy forces, the rescue chopper intended for Snake, delivers a withering amount of gunfire and saves the day. Holly and Snake finally make their way off Zanzibar Land.<\/p><p>Following this, Snake is freed from his nightmares relating to Outer Heaven and re-enters his retirement for the second time.<\/p><h2>Weapons and Equipment<\/h2><p>Snake encounters and can use many weapons and items on his quest to find Dr. Marv. Below are all usable items that can be found in the game.<\/p><h3>Weapons<\/h3><p><b>Handgun<\/b>: The standard military issued pistol, modelled after the Beretta, the handgun delivers is the first weapon Snake finds is useful in eliminating enemies from medium to short distances. The handgun can be equipped with a silencer to prevent alerting enemies during usage.<\/p><p><b>Sub Machine Gun<\/b>: The sub machine gun can be used to deliver a wave of bullets and can also be equipped with a silencer. The full auto effect does have a drawback of not firing in a straight line, however, the SMG can take out groups of enemies.<\/p><p><b>Grenade<\/b>: The grenade is helpful for taking out troops who are on another side of a wall or for fighting someone on a ledge. Grenades detonate on impact and go exactly where the crosshairs are, making them easy to use and easy to predict where they go.<\/p><p><b>Stinger<\/b>: An anti-air missile, the stinger is only used for fighting against the Hind. This weapon is aimed through the radar and will strike the location after a few seconds. After the encounter with the Hind, the stinger does not serve a purpose.<\/p><p><b>RC Missile<\/b>: These guided missiles can be used to strategically take out foes across the screen through skillful maneuvering.<\/p><p><b>Plastic Explosive<\/b>: A potent explosive device, this weapon can be used to take out sections of the wall that are hollow. Enemies can also be lead to them and killed as the plastic explosive is remote detonated, allowing for clever traps to be built.<\/p><p><b>Mine<\/b>: A hidden weapon, mines are not seen onscreen and can only be seen by the mine detector and picked up by crouching over the mine. A limit of sixteen mines can be placed and appear on the radar as solid white dots.<\/p><p><b>Camouflage Mat<\/b>: Helpful in stealth situations, the camo mat automatically takes the appearance of the surface it is placed on and can allow Snake to crawl under and be hidden from enemy view.<\/p><p><b>Gas Grenade<\/b>: This weapon is useful in determining wind direction by watching the direction the gas goes. Unfortunately, it doesn't serve much of a purpose past that.<\/p><p><b>Mouse<\/b>: A robotic windup toy, this mouse is useful for distracting enemies and sneaking by them while the mouse occupies the enemy.<\/p><p><b>Lighter<\/b>: A regular lighter, it serves no function unless paired with another item.<\/p><h3><b>Item<\/b>:<\/h3><p><b>Cigarettes<\/b>: Snake's lucky charm, cigarettes can detect lasers when thermal goggles are not in the inventory. However, use of cigarettes will slowly deplete Snake's health. Using cigarettes and tuning the codec to 140.07 allows the player to cycle randomly through the background music of the game.<\/p><p><b>Bandanna<\/b>: A Subsistence only bonus, the bandanna grants Snake infinite ammo with any weapon armed.<\/p><p><b>Night Vision Goggles<\/b>: Necessary for dark rooms and corridors, these goggles can illuminate even the darkest of locations.<\/p><p><b>Gas Mask<\/b>: This mask doubles the oxygen count when Snake enters rooms that have gas flowing in and slows the depletion of oxygen as well. Useful when no obvious door away from the gas is present or when traversing across gas-filled rooms.<\/p><p><b>Body Armor<\/b>: An important item, body armor halves the damage taken by bullets and is very useful against bosses and tight corridors where avoiding bullets is not easy.<\/p><p><b>Mine Detector<\/b>: Shows all maps in the vicinity on the map as solid white dots, which can then be defused by crouching over the mines.<\/p><p><b>Hang Glider<\/b>: Needed to get to the other side of Zanzibarland and can only be used at a high altitude. It serves no battle purpose.<\/p><p><b>Cardboard Box<\/b>: A Metal Gear signature, the cardboard box, with the destination going to Zanzibarland, can be used not only for sneaking purposes but for transport purposes by posing as materials.<\/p><p><b>Bucket<\/b>: A container large enough to hold Snake, the bucket works similar to the cardboard box.<\/p><p><b>Cold Medicine<\/b>: A good counter for the common cold, Snake can use cold medicine to prevent him from sneezing and alerting enemy forces.<\/p><p><b>Cassette Tape<\/b>: A tape that has the Zanzibarland national anthem, the tape can be played and stop all forces onscreen as they pay tribute to their nation.<\/p><p><b>Egg<\/b>: An egg taken from the biology lab, the egg will contain a snake or an owl which affect the gameplay differently.<\/p><p><b>Brooch<\/b>: Gustava's personal item with the Zanzibarland logo embedded in it, the brooch can be altered physically with certain applications of temperature.<\/p><p><b>IC Cards<\/b> (1-9, Red, Blue, Green): IC Cards are needed in exploring Zanzibarland and unlocking doors to continue the operation. Color cards are master cards of certain IC cards and make cycling through the keycards easier.<\/p><p><b>Cartridge<\/b>: Master copy of Dr. Marv's OILIX formula placed within the MSX cart.<\/p><p><b>Rations<\/b> (B1-B3): A military standby, rations can restore health and when equipped, Snake will automatically use them if he about to die. Each ration has a different package of food and can be used in game for different effects.<\/p><p><b>Spray<\/b>: A typical aerosol can, it serves no function unless paired with another item.<\/p><h2>Releases<\/h2><p>Metal Gear 2 was released in Japan on the MSX2 home computer system on July 19, 1990.

Like its predecessor, Metal Gear Solid is a game which revolves around <a href=\"\/stealth\/3015-24\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-24\">stealth<\/a>, so <a href=\"\/solid-snake\/3005-75\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-75\">Snake<\/a> will spend most of his time avoiding enemy detection. Utilizing his ability to walk quietly, crawl, and press against walls, Snake can avoid attracting enemy attention. Snake can also take out enemies by grabbing them and knocking them out, or utilizing the variety of weapons in his arsenal to take them down. Unfortunately, making any sort of noise will alert other guards in <a href=\"\/shadow-moses\/3035-41\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-41\">Shadow Moses<\/a>. If Snake is detected, the game will go into alert phase, bringing extra guards to the area as long as alert mode is active. In this mode, Snake must either fight or make flight, though most often, he must escape, as he is at a disadvantage. If Snake manages to sneak away, the game enters the evasion phase in which the guards will be actively searching for Snake, though they are not aware of his presence. If Snake can hide long enough, the game will go to normal sneaking mode. If Snake is found in evasion phase, the game will return to alert status. In both alert and evasion phases, Snake cannot use his Soliton <a href=\"\/radar\/3015-3542\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3542\">radar<\/a>.<\/p><p>Like in Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, the Soliton radar becomes a handy tool for Snake, showing him enemy positions and their respective vision cones, therefore making it easier for him to avoid detection. In alert, evasion, and jamming phases, the radar becomes unusable. Snake has no radar in the harder difficulty levels of the game.<\/p><p>The player moves Snake around the environment using the D-pad or analog sticks, which are also used to look around when in <a href=\"\/first-person-perspective\/3015-330\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-330\">first person mode<\/a>. The first person mode is initiated by pressing the triangle button. To sneak around, Snake will often be crawling, initiated by pressing the X button. The X button also allows snake to crouch, which allows him to stay out of sight behind short boxes or other objects. Snake can press against walls as well, a technique often used for sneaking. By holding the X button and the shoot button, Snake can shoot while running. With his back to the wall, Snake can use the square button to knock on walls, which will attract enemy attention, possibly allowing Snake to sneak off in the other direction.<\/p><p>Snake's inventory is sorted into two menus on the left and right side of the screen. The right menu shows all weapons currently in Snake's inventory, while the left menu shows all other items Snake is carrying. The player uses the L2 button to bring up the item menu, and the R2 button to bring up the weapons. When the player brings up either menu, the game pauses, the inventory borders the screen, and it can be navigated with the D-pad. The L1 and R1 buttons are used from weapon and item quick changes. Snake is able to use many weapons throughout his mission, including <a href=\"\/pistol\/3055-59\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-59\">pistols<\/a> and <a href=\"\/claymore\/3055-1272\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1272\">claymores<\/a>.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6550\/355632-grabbed_frame_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-355632\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6550\/355632-grabbed_frame_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-355632\"><img alt=\"The codec\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6550\/355632-grabbed_frame_4.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6550\/355632-grabbed_frame_4.jpg 640w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/6550\/355632-grabbed_frame_4.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6550\/355632-grabbed_frame_4.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The codec\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6550\/355632-grabbed_frame_4.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6550\/355632-grabbed_frame_4.jpg 640w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/6550\/355632-grabbed_frame_4.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6550\/355632-grabbed_frame_4.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The codec<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>To access the <a href=\"\/codec\/3015-2355\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2355\">codec<\/a>, the player presses the select button. Often throughout the game, the codec will ring and a message will display, informing the player that they have received a call. Pressing the select button will answer the call. Whenever the player needs to save or consult any of the other characters, he can access the codec menu and then either choose from saved frequencies or search for a frequency manually. The codec is very important, both for saving and telling the story.<\/p><p>The circle and square buttons are used for combat. The square button is the weapon button, and when pressed, Snake will fire the equipped weapon. Without any weapons equipped, Snake can use the square button to throw or choke an enemy he has grabbed. The circle button will unleash Snake's devastating punch and kick combo. Snake will attack in the direction he is facing, which is altered using the D-pad or analog sticks.<\/p><p>One of the most memorable aspects of Metal Gear Solid is the unusual pieces of gameplay that go beyond stealth. The game introduces the <a href=\"\/torture\/3015-2574\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2574\">torture<\/a> event, which became a staple for later titles. While being tortured, the player has to press a button repeatedly to keep Snake alive (Also known as ''Button Mashing'' sequences). The game also has sequences borrowed from its predecessor Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, including ones that take Snake's equipment away, require Snake to rappel down a building, and other off-beat sequences. Snake will find his mission is much more difficult then simply avoiding enemy detection.<\/p><p>There is one known difference between the US and Japanese versions of MGS1 on the <a href=\"\/playstation\/3045-22\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PSX<\/a>. In the Japanese version, if the codec frequency is dialled to 140.66 in the Snowfield, and two other locations, it plays a song.

The Mantis fight really is a memorable experience as the designers used the <a href=\"\/playstation\/3045-22\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PlayStation<\/a> hardware in truly innovative ways to freak out gamers. During the beginning of the fight, Mantis will read the player's Memory Card for certain <a href=\"\/konami-corporation\/3010-87\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-87\">Konami<\/a> games like <a href=\"\/castlevania-symphony-of-the-night\/3030-14216\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14216\">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night<\/a>, and comment on them.

Big Boss was revered as the perfect soldier back in the day, but he defects and starts to work to destroy the <i>Patriots<\/i>. Liquid and Solid Snake are both products of the <i>Les Enfants Terribles<\/i> project. According to Liquid, Solid Snake received all of Big Boss's dominant genes, and that he got stuck with the recessive genes. The genome soldiers that had been guarding the base had been genetically conditioned, using the research born from Les Enfants Terribles project. Liquid wishes to surpass their father's dream of a world of war, where soldiers can have a purpose.<\/p><h3>Life or Death<\/h3><p>Metal Gear Solid has two different endings. The most common ending is that when the player has finished <a href=\"\/hand-to-hand-combat\/3015-288\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-288\">fist-fighting<\/a> with Liquid on top of the destroyed Metal Gear REX, Snake runs over to <a href=\"\/meryl-silverburgh\/3005-440\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-440\">Meryl<\/a> only to find her dead. Snake says, \"I gave into my fear! I gave into my pain! I sold your life to save my own... I'm a loser. I'm not the hero you thought I was! I'm nothing!!!\" Then <a href=\"\/otacon\/3005-150\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-150\">Otacon<\/a> shows up and talks about how \"Death is not Defeat\". Now Snake's little speech should have raised a red flag. He is referring directly to the <a href=\"\/torture-chamber\/3035-1673\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1673\">torture chamber<\/a> section of the game. If the player hits the \"Select\" button during either of the torture sequences, then they are doomed to the \"Hal and Dave\" ending. Surviving <a href=\"\/revolver-ocelot\/3005-346\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-346\">Ocelot<\/a>'s electric shock torture is no joke though, especially on the original PlayStation version (it is easier on <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-the-twin-snakes\/3030-9594\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9594\">The Twin Snakes<\/a>).<\/p><h3>Ghosts<\/h3><p>Once a playthrough of Metal Gear Solid is complete, the player will be given a digital camera. They can use the camera on their next playthrough to take pictures. It's possible to also see \"ghosts\" of the Metal Gear Solid development team, which are scattered throughout the game. Most memorably, they can snap a picture of Hideo Kojima's ghost rising up from the steam of the guard's urine in the men's bathroom of the second base after the M1 Abrams tank battle.<\/p><h2>Character Codec Frequencies<\/h2><ul><li><a href=\"\/colonel-roy-cambell\/3005-839\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-839\">Colonel Roy Campbell<\/a> 140.85<\/li><li><a href=\"\/naomi-hunter\/3005-890\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-890\">Naomi Hunter<\/a> 140.85<\/li><li><a href=\"\/mei-ling\/3005-4903\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4903\">Mei Ling<\/a> 140.96<\/li><li><a href=\"\/nastasha-romanenko\/3005-4871\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4871\">Nastasha Romanenko<\/a> 141.52<\/li><li><a href=\"\/master-miller\/3005-5186\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5186\">Master Miller<\/a> 141.80<\/li><li><a href=\"\/meryl-silverburgh\/3005-440\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-440\">Meryl Silverburgh<\/a> 140.15<\/li><li><a href=\"\/otacon\/3005-150\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-150\">Hal Emmerich (Otacon)<\/a> 141.12<\/li><\/ul><h2>Releases<\/h2><p>An enhanced version of the game, titled Metal Gear Solid: Integral, was released in Japan on June 24, 1999.

His mission is to infiltrate the Galuade headquarters, to find out information on the new Metal Gear prototype codenamed \"Gander\" which they had stolen. The headquarters in which Snake has to infiltrate was formerly know as Outer Haven which makes appearances in other metal gear solid titles. The bosses in the game are known as the members of Black Chamber. Hawk, Owl, Bison and Viper, names that all use the same animal motif as FOXHOUND does in Metal Gear Solid.<\/p><h2>Timeline<\/h2><p>Many people assumed this game was a prequel to 1998's Metal Gear Solid, but that is incorrect. In the GBC game, Snake meets Mei Ling for the first time over the Codec. However, he also speaks to her for the first time in the PlayStation game, therefore the two games take place in separate continuities. The game does, however, refer to events in Metal Gear 1 and 2, specifically the fortress of Outer Heaven, where Big Boss made his stand. So the Game Boy Color game can be seen as an alternate 'what-if' timeline, where this game takes place at the same time as the PlayStation game did, as Snake is brought out of retirement.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><p>Pulled out of retirement infiltration specialist and ex-Fox-Hound member Solid Snake is sent to Africa under the orders that a new Metal Gear (with the code name Gander) has been hijacked and is being kept in a compound called Galude and guarded by mercenary force Black Chamber under orders by the Gindra Liberation Front 'GLF'.<\/p><p>Snake is assisted with known characters such as Colonel Roy Campbell and Mei Ling as well as new supporting characters lone Delta Force Chris Jenner.<\/p><p>As Snake advances in his mission he will have rescued Metal Gear designer <a href=\"\/jimmy-harks\/3005-7886\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-7886\">Jimmy Harks<\/a>, taken down the places power plant, confronted all members of Black Chamber in combat and uncover a story that involves conspiracies and the U.S government's involvement with the GLF.<\/p><h2>Characters<\/h2><h3>Main<\/h3><ul><li><a href=\"\/solid-snake\/3005-75\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-75\">Solid Snake<\/a> - An ex-Fox-Hound mercenary who has been pulled out of retirement in Alaska to investigate the hi-jacking of a Metal Gear over Africa in the state of Galude.

It is considered the first truly postmodern video game, is frequently cited as a primary example of artistic expression in video games, and is generally considered one of the most influential games of the past decade, both for its artistic influence on later video game storylines (most notably <a href=\"\/eternal-darkness-sanitys-requiem\/3030-7512\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7512\">Eternal Darkness<\/a>, <a href=\"\/killer7\/3030-18347\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18347\">Killer7<\/a>, <a href=\"\/portal\/3030-21170\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21170\">Portal<\/a>, and especially <a href=\"\/bioshock\/3030-17280\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17280\">BioShock<\/a>, which even featured a very similar plot twist) as well as its influence on the gameplay mechanics of many action games since.<\/p><h2>Plot<\/h2><p>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty does not star <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid\/3030-16140\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16140\">MGS<\/a> hero, <a href=\"\/solid-snake\/3005-75\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-75\">Solid Snake<\/a>, but instead a new character codenamed <a href=\"\/raiden\/3005-347\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-347\">Raiden<\/a>. Raiden himself received a lot of flak because gamers complained he was too whiny and effeminate. Additionally the game was touted as being far too convoluted by some, especially in its ending, and many elements of sci-fi and fantasy such as <a href=\"\/vampire\/3015-117\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-117\">vampires<\/a> and other immortal beings were introduced that didn't mesh well with some of the Metal Gear Solid community at the time. Other issues that raised controversy at the time was the game's exploration of taboos such as incest and sexual orientation, and the plot's blurring of the line between fantasy and reality (which was in fact one of the game's stated goals in Hideo Kojima's original design document).<\/p><p>Despite being controversial at the time, Metal Gear Solid 2 has over the years become accepted as the first truly postmodern video game and is often cited a primary example of artistic expression in video games.

The president has been taken hostage by a group of terrorists known as <a href=\"\/dead-cell\/3015-3703\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3703\">Dead Cell<\/a>, and are also threatening to launch a nuclear weapon, if demands aren't met. The leader of the operation is the third clone of <a href=\"\/big-boss\/3005-475\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-475\">Big Boss<\/a>, named <a href=\"\/solidus-snake\/3005-909\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-909\">Solidus Snake<\/a>. Throughout the game Raiden must confront members of Dead Cell, which features an immortal psychic armed with a Ray Gun named <a href=\"\/fortune\/3005-2454\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2454\">Fortune<\/a>, a mad bomber aptly named <a href=\"\/fatman\/3005-2216\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2216\">Fatman<\/a> who has planted bombs all over the Shell, and a man who appears to be a vampire, conveniently named <a href=\"\/vamp\/3005-945\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-945\">Vamp<\/a>. It turns out that Snake has also come along for the ride, disguised as a <a href=\"\/united-states-marine-corps\/3015-2241\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2241\">Marine<\/a> by the name of Iroquois Pliskin. While the player doesn't control Snake he does provide key support and advice, along with Otacon, to Raiden during the mission.<\/p><p>The first thing Raiden must do, if he stands a chance of finding the President, is disarming the numerous bombs Fatman has planted on each of the Struts, and he does so with the help of Snake, and a bomb specialist by the name of Peter Stillman. Stillman happens to be the mentor of Fatman, and is killed by one of Fatman's bombs, which submerges parts of the shell. After Fatman's defeat Raiden encounters a mysterious Ninja, who first introduces itself as Deep Throat, but then changes that to Mr. X. Mr. X tells Raiden to find a man named Ames, in the B1 core, as this man knows the location of the President. Mr. X does not know what Ames looks like, but does know that Ames has a pacemaker.<\/p><p>Raiden, armed with a Guard's Uniform and AK-47, and a Directional Mic, infiltrates the Core and finds Ames - amongst a large number of other hostages. Ames confirms to Raiden that the Big Shell is indeed a cover up for the development for a new Metal Gear project. Raiden is discovered by Revolver Ocelot, and the stress causes Ames to die of a heart attack. Ocelot is about to kill Raiden but Mr. X appears and distracts Ocelot, allowing for Raiden's escape. Raiden is the confronted by a Harrier Jet, piloted by Vamp and Solidus.<\/p><p>Raiden finds his way to the President and learns several important things; firstly, Big Shell is actually a giant Metal Gear called Arsenal Gear. Secondly, Arsenal Gear houses a powerful super computer called GW which is responsible for controlling and organizing all information we humans are aware of in the digital age. Lastly, the president informs Raiden that the <a href=\"\/the-united-states-of-america\/3035-396\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-396\">United States<\/a> is in fact run by a small organization of people called <a href=\"\/the-patriots\/3005-4583\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4583\">The Patriots<\/a>. Raiden and Snake recover Otacon's sister, <a href=\"\/emma-emmerich\/3005-1870\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1870\">Emma<\/a> and install a virus to destroy GW but not before Emma is killed by Vamp. The destroying of GW causes <a href=\"\/colonel-roy-campbell\/3005-839\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-839\">Colonel Campbell<\/a> to constantly call Raiden and speak irrelevant phrases and state things irrelevant to the mission, often not making any sense at all. This also causes Colonel Campbell's face to appear disfigured and buggy over the Codec. The reason for this is that the Colonel Campbell we have been talking to throughout the game is actually a creation by GW from bits of information gathered about the real Campbell and what Raiden himself expected the Colonel to be like.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3727\/182637-480px_solidus_snake.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-182637\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.25\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:125.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3727\/182637-480px_solidus_snake.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-182637\"><img alt=\"Solidus Snake, the Perfect Clone of Big Boss.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3727\/182637-480px_solidus_snake.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3727\/182637-480px_solidus_snake.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3727\/182637-480px_solidus_snake.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Solidus Snake, the Perfect Clone of Big Boss.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3727\/182637-480px_solidus_snake.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3727\/182637-480px_solidus_snake.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3727\/182637-480px_solidus_snake.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Solidus Snake, the Perfect Clone of Big Boss.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>A number of intense action sequences shortly follow with Raiden fighting off 25 Metal Gear RAYs alone on top of Arsenal Gear. He then confronts Solidus, who was a twisted father figure of sorts for him, in a climactic battle on the roof of Federal Hall. Raiden learns that The Patriots were attempting to control what kind of information is kept and what is left behind on the internet in an attempt to make future historians see a history that The Patriots want them to see. The Patriots also reveal that the entire Big Shell Incident was an elaborate scheme of theirs to make Raiden into a soldier who was equally as skilled as Solid Snake. This new Snake would be forged in battle (as opposed to using <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-vr-missions\/3030-8761\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8761\">VR Training<\/a>), which explains how the events of this game were at their core so similar to those of the first Metal Gear Solid. Solidus was trying to overthrow the Patriots and use <a href=\"\/manhattan\/3035-1613\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1613\">Manhattan<\/a> as his base of operations, and since he believed Raiden's neural implant could lead him back to the Patriots, they duel.

MGS2 introduced a host of new gameplay mechanics that would become staples of 3D action games for years to come.<\/p><p>Like its predecessor, players once again try to sneak by enemy guards, avoid being seen on <a href=\"\/camera\/3055-247\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-247\">cameras<\/a>, and fight ridiculous <a href=\"\/bosses\/3015-229\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-229\">bosses<\/a>. Players still viewed the action from a <a href=\"\/top-down-perspective\/3015-788\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-788\">top-down perspective<\/a> for much of the game, but the camera would occasionally switch to more cinematic perspectives during many key moments of the game.<\/p><p>The game introduced a number of new game mechanics and features, which included dead bodies that don't disappear and need to be hidden away from other guards, enemies being able to detect the player's shadows, the player being able to take out lights in an area to affect the enemy's vision, and realistic enemy artificial intelligence that relies on squad tactics rather than working individually. A major innovation to the gameplay was the introduction of multi-level environments that add an element of three-dimensional \"vertical tension\" to the stealth gameplay, which was previously limited to level surfaces in earlier titles. This gave the player many new options on how to approach a situation, which included being able to attack or perform various actions from above ceilings, from underwater, or from underneath floors.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3689\/238466-raiden23.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-238466\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3689\/238466-raiden23.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-238466\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3689\/238466-raiden23.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3689\/238466-raiden23.jpg 400w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3689\/238466-raiden23.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3689\/238466-raiden23.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3689\/238466-raiden23.jpg 400w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3689\/238466-raiden23.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>Another very important innovation in MGS2 was the game's shooting mechanic. In the original game, Snake had to fire at enemies from the same top-down view. The perspective was optimal for sneaking, but cumbersome in a situation that required accurate shooting. MGS2 added the ability to fire weapons from a <a href=\"\/first-person-perspective\/3015-330\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-330\">first-person perspective<\/a>. Snake could still shoot without entering First-Person, but holding down the fire button while in a First Person View mode would cause Snake to raise his gun up, allowing him to aim using the weapon's <a href=\"\/laser-sight\/3055-1819\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1819\">laser sight<\/a>. The game utilized the Dualshock 2's pressure sensitive buttons in that applying various amounts of pressure would allow the player to aim the weapon without actually firing it or putting down the weapon without firing it. The first-person firing added much greater depth to the shooting mechanics of the previous game, by allowing true three-dimensional aiming, whether at different parts of the enemy's body, at various different objects, or at different areas of the game's new multi-level environments.<\/p><p>MGS2 also provided players with a number of options should sneaking be the optimal course of action. Most obviously, Raiden came into combat with a silenced, one-shot <a href=\"\/tranquilizer\/3055-853\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-853\">tranquilizer<\/a> <a href=\"\/pistol\/3055-59\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-59\">pistol<\/a>, which could knock opponents unconscious (faster or slower depending on where they were hit). Bodies could now be stored in lockers to keep them out of sight from other guards. Raiden could, like snake, press up against walls and peak down hallways, but MGS2 provided Raiden the ability to pop out into the hallway and fire shots. Raiden could also move much more slowly and quietly than Snake, keeping him moving without being heard by guards.<\/p><p>The game also introduced a <a href=\"\/cover-system\/3015-55\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-55\">cover system<\/a>, with Solid Snake or Raiden now able to take cover behind walls or objects and pop out to shoot at enemies, while the improved enemy AI allowed enemies to also take cover from the player character. The enemies would often take cover to call for backup, but during battle, they would take cover then pop out and shoot at the player or blindly throw grenades from behind their cover. MGS2's cover system would later be refined by <a href=\"\/killswitch\/3030-1152\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1152\">Kill Switch<\/a> and popularized by <a href=\"\/gears-of-war\/3030-12231\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12231\">Gears of War<\/a>. MGS2 also introduced an innovative <a href=\"\/laser-sight\/3055-1819\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1819\">laser sight<\/a> mechanic, where a laser sight helps assist with manually aiming a gun, which would later be widely adopted by third-person shooters such as <a href=\"\/resident-evil-4\/3030-1578\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1578\">Resident Evil 4<\/a> and Gears of War.<\/p><h3>Artificial Intelligence<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6664\/263017-screengp_03_l.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-263017\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.74545454545455\" data-width=\"550\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 550px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6664\/263017-screengp_03_l.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-263017\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6664\/263017-screengp_03_l.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6664\/263017-screengp_03_l.jpg 550w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/6664\/263017-screengp_03_l.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6664\/263017-screengp_03_l.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6664\/263017-screengp_03_l.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6664\/263017-screengp_03_l.jpg 550w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/6664\/263017-screengp_03_l.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/6664\/263017-screengp_03_l.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>MGS2 offered significant upgrades to the guard routines featured in <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid\/3030-16140\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16140\">Metal Gear Solid<\/a> for the <a href=\"\/playstation\/3045-22\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PlayStation<\/a>.

Other new additions to the enemy AI include being able to detect the player's shadows, being able to hear the player sneezing from a cold, the player being able to take out lights in an area to affect the enemy's vision, and the enemies even being able to <a href=\"\/cover-system\/3015-55\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-55\">take cover<\/a> from the player (an innovation that wouldn't become popular until many years later).<\/p><p>The most important innovation to the enemy artificial intelligence was the introduction of a collective intelligence that relied on squad tactics, in contrast to previous games where guards only worked individually. This time in MGS2, guards would call on their radios for a strike team upon seeing the player, then attempt to flank him and cut off his escape while avoiding the player's attacks. Often strike teams will carry body armor and riot shields, making them an even greater threat. Even if the player escapes to a hiding place, a team will sweep in to check the area. The game has a collective enemy AI, where enemy guards work together in squads, can communicate with one another, and react in a more realistic manner towards the player. The game's enemy AI was considered one of the best in gaming for many years.<\/p><p>Guards who spotted Raiden would automatically radio for additional units to combat the player. Avoiding the guards in their alert phase (by hiding in lockers, under tables, etc.) would trigger the guard's caution phase. Guards won't be actively pursuing Raiden, but will be much more alert in this phase, searching rooms and lockers, and constantly radioing back to headquarters. If the player stays for too long in the alert phase, additional, stronger units (armed with better weapons and shields) will try to overwhelm Raiden.<\/p><p>Players with a steady aim can stop a guard from calling for more units by quickly shooting his <a href=\"\/walkie-talkie\/3055-631\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-631\">walkie-talkie<\/a> before he has time to use it. If the guard starts requesting for backup and the player then shoots the walkie-talkie, HQ will become suspicious and send reinforcements either way. If the player shoots the walkie-talkie before the request for backup, the guard will run to the nearest exit from the level and request backup from there.<\/p><h3>Bosses<\/h3><p>- <a href=\"\/olga-gurlukovich\/3005-2672\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2672\">Olga Gurlukovich<\/a><\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1120976-fatman1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1120976\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.372\" data-width=\"250\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:137.2%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1120976-fatman1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1120976\"><img alt=\"Fatman\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1120976-fatman1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1120976-fatman1.jpg 250w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Fatman\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1120976-fatman1.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1120976-fatman1.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px\" data-width=\"250\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Fatman<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>- Gurlukovich Soldiers<\/p><p>- <a href=\"\/fortune\/3005-2454\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2454\">Fortune<\/a><\/p><p>- <a href=\"\/fatman\/3005-2216\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2216\">Fatman<\/a><\/p><p>- The <a href=\"\/harrier-vstol-jump-jet\/3055-4714\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-4714\">Harrier<\/a><\/p><p>- <a href=\"\/vamp\/3005-945\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-945\">Vamp<\/a><\/p><p>- Arsenal Tengu<\/p><p>- <a href=\"\/metal-gear-ray\/3055-3540\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-3540\">Metal Gear Ray<\/a> Units (mass produced)<\/p><p>- <a href=\"\/solidus-snake\/3005-909\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-909\">Solidus Snake<\/a><\/p><h2>Soundtracks<\/h2><h3>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty Original Soundtrack<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6436\/504687-mgs2ost.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-504687\" data-size=\"large\" data-ratio=\"1.0066666666667\" data-width=\"300\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6436\/504687-mgs2ost.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-504687\"><img alt=\"MGS2: Sons of Liberty Soundtrack\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6436\/504687-mgs2ost.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6436\/504687-mgs2ost.jpg 300w\"><noscript><img alt=\"MGS2: Sons of Liberty Soundtrack\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6436\/504687-mgs2ost.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/6436\/504687-mgs2ost.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-width=\"300\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>MGS2: Sons of Liberty Soundtrack<\/figcaption><\/figure><ol><li>Metal Gear Solid Main Theme<\/li><li>Opening Infiltration<\/li><li>Russian Soldiers from Kasatka<\/li><li>Olga Gurlukovich<\/li><li>Metal Gear<\/li><li>Revolver Ocelot<\/li><li>RAY Escapes<\/li><li>Can't Say Goodbye to Yesterday (Piano Version)<\/li><li>Big Shell<\/li><li>Fortune<\/li><li>Kill Me Now!<\/li><li>Vamp<\/li><li>The World Needs Only One Big Boss<\/li><li>It's the Harrier!<\/li><li>Arsenal is Going to Take Off<\/li><li>Who Am I Really?<\/li><li>Can't Say Goodbye to Yesterday (Full Version)<\/li><\/ol><h3>Metal Gear Solid 2: The Other Side<\/h3><ol><li>Tanker Incident<\/li><li>The Elevator Up To Hell<\/li><li>Vamp's Dance<\/li><li>Infiltration<\/li><li>Battle<\/li><li>Peter's Theme<\/li><li>Countdown To Disaster<\/li><li>Lady Luck Revisited<\/li><li>Yell \"Dead Cell\"<\/li><li>Metal Gear's Already Active<\/li><li>Arms Depot<\/li><li>Memories of Hal<\/li><li>Twilight Sniping<\/li><li>Will the Virus Still Work<\/li><li>Comradeship<\/li><li>Reminiscence<\/li><li>Arsenal's Guts<\/li><li>Prelude to the Denouement<\/li><li>Father and Son<\/li><li>Freedom to Decide<\/li><\/ol><h3>Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance<\/h3><ol><li>Can't Say Goodbye to Yesterday (Mix)<\/li><li>Opening Infiltration A (Original Mix)<\/li><li>Opening Infiltration B (Original Mix)<\/li><li>Revolver Ocelot (Original Mix)<\/li><li>Arsenal is Going to Take Off!

Portions of the script were retranslated, as well, and all of the game's voicework was re-recorded. According to various sources, David Hayter (the voice of Solid Snake) used half of his paycheck to bring the original actors back to reprise their respective roles. The <a href=\"\/gray-fox\/3005-901\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-901\">Ninja<\/a> however, was voiced by Rob Paulsen instead of Greg Eagles.

He enters from an <a href=\"\/underwater\/3035-719\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-719\">underwater<\/a> entrance and then sneaks past the guards and onto the ground level of the facility on <a href=\"\/shadow-moses\/3035-41\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-41\">Shadow Moses<\/a> Island. He proceeds throughout the game by <a href=\"\/sneaking-mission\/3015-3406\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3406\">sneaking<\/a> past enemies and, when necessary, by engaging them in gun fights.

In order to do that the player to resist they must mash on the action button. This is where the ending of the game is determined. If Snake resists it leads to the <a href=\"\/meryl-silverburgh\/3005-440\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-440\">Meryl<\/a> ending. If Snake surrenders to the torture it leads to the <a href=\"\/\">Otacon<\/a> ending. <a href=\"\/solid-snake\/3005-75\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-75\">Snake<\/a> then goes to fight <a href=\"\/sniper-wolf\/3005-870\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-870\">Sniper Wolf<\/a>, but this time she dies.

To progress, Snake must use the key after it has been heated and cooled one time each. In the original version, this requires the player to backtrack to earlier areas with extreme temperature environments and then race back to the control room before the card's state resets. Twin Snakes features a streamlined option to solving this puzzle by including hot and cold pipes in the Rex hanger that can be shot. The steam from these pipes is capable of cooling or heating the PAL key, preventing the need to backtrack, though the option to backtrack is still present.<\/li><\/ul><h3>Easter Eggs<\/h3><ul><li><a href=\"\/dog-tag\/3055-1235\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1235\">Dog tags<\/a> were added for Twin Snakes as collectable items.

Melee<\/a> and Eternal Darkness.<\/li><li>The three portraits hanging in the office where Psycho Mantis is fought are pictures of Metal Gear creator Hideo Kojima, Nintendo game designer and producer Shigeru Miyamoto, and Silicon Knights head and game director Denis Dyack.<\/li><\/ul><h2>Reception<\/h2><p>For the most part, The Twin Snakes was openly accepted by fans. Many believe that it captured the story and atmosphere of the original, but also introduced necessary improvements which made the game more accessible. However, the new gameplay elements have been deemed as unnecessary by some. The level design of The Twin Snakes is practically unchanged from the original Metal Gear Solid which makes the new control scheme seem almost out of place. It has also been stated this new introduction makes them game too straightforward, and practically ruins many of the once challenging battles.<\/p><p>The Twin Snakes also received some negative feedback regarding changes to the script and <a href=\"\/cutscene\/3015-22\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-22\">cutscenes<\/a>. Seemingly unnecessary small changes to the script and voice acting were jarring to fans and the new over-the-top cut scenes were felt to detract from the experience for some. The cutscenes were also criticized for its heavy use of the <a href=\"\/bullet-time\/3015-78\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-78\">bullet-time<\/a> effect, which many people felt to be too excessive and felt like it was trying to be the next Matrix movie.

A new engine was created for Snake Eater in order to create a richer graphical experience, and the gameplay was opened up to allow for more aggressive approaches.<\/p><p>An updated version of Snake Eater, <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-3-subsistence\/3030-10267\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10267\">Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence<\/a>, was released on March 14, 2006, featuring a large number of side content in the style of <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-vr-missions\/3030-8761\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8761\">VR Missions<\/a>, and, most notably, an improved fully controllable camera, a first for the series. Snake Eater was packaged with the <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-hd-collection\/3030-35508\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-35508\">Metal Gear Solid HD Collection<\/a> in 2011 for PS3 and 360; in February 2012 Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater 3D was released for the 3DS. Unfortunately, the bizarre <a href=\"\/guy-savage\/3005-24540\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-24540\">Guy Savage<\/a> nightmare is only playable in the original and Subsistence releases.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>Traditional to the Metal Gear Solid series, MGS3 focuses on <a href=\"\/stealth\/3015-24\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-24\">stealth<\/a> and <a href=\"\/sneaking-mission\/3015-3406\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3406\">sneaking<\/a> around enemies rather than straight up confronting them in a gunfight, though this entry is more forgiving in that regard, and offers up a large number of guns with which to shoot folks. If the player is spotted, the guards will enter an alert mode. At ALERT: 99.99, the enemy can see Snake and is currently firing at him. Until Snake breaks line of sight for a sustained period of time the counter will not drop. At ALERT: 99.98 and below, the enemy is still searching for Snake. If the counter runs down to 0, the game enters EVASION mode. In EVASION, the enemy is still looking for Snake, but not as vigorously. If that counter runs down, the game will enter CAUTION mode. The enemy has given up searching for Snake, but is still aware of his presence. Guards who were called in as backup firepower will return to the nearest barracks, and any patrol guards killed during the firefight will be replaced.<\/p><p>Because of the 60s setting, the <a href=\"\/radar\/3015-3542\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3542\">radar<\/a> in previous games has not been invented, and the player must rely on special equipment. The active sonar, activated with the L3 button, sends out a rather noisy ping, and reports the location of all animals and people, but the noise the ping makes may alert the enemy. The motion detector reports the location of all moving objects, but not stationary ones. The AP sensor vibrates the controller upon detecting an enemy. Snake can also use a <a href=\"\/mine-detector\/3055-1467\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1467\">mine detector<\/a> to locate <a href=\"\/claymore\/3055-1272\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1272\">claymores<\/a>. These items take up battery power, which refills when not in use. If the battery runs out completely, the items that use battery power will not operate for a short period of time.<\/p><p>The game also has the <a href=\"\/survival\/3015-1297\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1297\">survival<\/a> system, which was new to this game. The <a href=\"\/stamina-bar\/3015-3569\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3569\">stamina meter<\/a>, below the health bar, determines how fast Snake runs, how much his health recovers, and how well he aims. To replenish this, Snake can capture animals by shooting them or attacking them with his knife. He can then eat them, which replenishes the stamina in various amounts. Snake has different affinities to different foods.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8480\/224000-snake6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-224000\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75040518638574\" data-width=\"617\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 617px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8480\/224000-snake6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-224000\"><img alt=\"Camouflage\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8480\/224000-snake6.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8480\/224000-snake6.jpg 617w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/8480\/224000-snake6.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8480\/224000-snake6.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>Camouflage<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The <a href=\"\/camouflage\/3015-149\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-149\">camouflage<\/a> system determines how well hidden Snake is in the surrounding environment. Snake has a variety of uniforms and face paints he can wear, each blending him in more or making him stick out more. If he gets injured, he can use the cure screen to heal himself. Snake can have various injuries like cuts and burns, and can use medical supplies to cure them.<\/p><p>New to this game also is <a href=\"\/cqccqb\/3015-865\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-865\">CQC<\/a>. If Snake has a CQC compatible weapon, he can sneak up to an enemy and grab him by pressing the circle button and holding it, he can then transition into a number of moves. He can slit his throat by holding down the circle button firmly, interrogate him by holding down the left stick, choke him by mashing circle many times, or use him as a <a href=\"\/human-shield\/3015-176\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-176\">human shield<\/a> to defend against enemy fire. As was the case in MGS2, enemies will respond to being held up, and will drop items when Snake aims his weapon at their head or crotch. They can be knocked out, put to sleep or killed. Snake can shoot their radios dead so they can't call for armed backup, use noise to distract them, and aim for their limbs to limit movement or stop them from wielding firearms. The boss battles, as with all MGS games, present the player with a number of unique situations, such as a sniper battle which can last hours, a man who throws bees, a river of ghosts and more.<\/p><p>The camera in this game does not have a 3D rotational camera of other action games, but rather the stationary camera of past Metal Gear Solid games. The main camera is a roughly <a href=\"\/isometric-viewpoint\/3015-246\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-246\">isometric<\/a> camera, which can be panned, but not rotated, by the R stick. An optional, (now-traditional) 3D rotational camera with full player control was added in <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-3-subsistence\/3030-10267\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10267\">Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence<\/a>. The other main camera is the <a href=\"\/first-person-perspective\/3015-330\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-330\">first person view<\/a>. Snake cannot move while in first person, but can see the world around him, and aim his weapon by pressing square. If Snake presses up against a wall, he can see the area around the corner, and can get and even better view by peeking, which is done by pressing L2 or R2. The last camera angle is infiltration mode. When lying down in tall grass of crawling through a hole, the game enters first person mode, but the player is able to move around.<\/p><h3><b>Camouflage<\/b><\/h3><h4><b>Face<\/b><\/h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1120760-k3302.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1120760\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75689655172414\" data-width=\"580\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 580px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1120760-k3302.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1120760\"><img alt=\"Kabuki Face Camouflage\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4527\/1120760-k3302.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/4527\/1120760-k3302.jpg 580w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/4527\/1120760-k3302.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/4527\/1120760-k3302.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>Kabuki Face Camouflage<\/figcaption><\/figure><ul><li>Black: Black face paint.

At the outset, Naked Snake is sent behind enemy lines via a HA-LO jump to retrieve a <a href=\"\/russia\/3035-38\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-38\">Russian<\/a> weapons designer named <a href=\"\/sokolov\/3005-4168\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-4168\">Sokolov<\/a><\/p><p>who wishes to defect to the <a href=\"\/the-united-states-of-america\/3035-396\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-396\">United States<\/a>. Sokolov has developed an advanced tank named the <a href=\"\/shagohod\/3055-453\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-453\">Shagohod<\/a>, which is a direct precursor to the bipedal <a href=\"\/metal-gear\/3055-28\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-28\">Metal Gear<\/a> weapons which threaten global stability in the other series installments. Snake is aided over the radio by new characters like Major <a href=\"\/zero\/3005-476\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-476\">Zero<\/a>, <a href=\"\/para-medic\/3005-3812\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3812\">Para-Medic<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/the-boss\/3005-478\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-478\">The Boss<\/a>, his former mentor. After finding Sokolov under strict protection from the Red Army, a new Russian faction is explained by Sokolov named GRU, a radical movement within Soviet government under the control of a <a href=\"\/colonel-volgin\/3005-3545\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3545\">Colonel Volgin<\/a>. Snake and Sokolov are confronted by GRU soldiers as well as a young <a href=\"\/revolver-ocelot\/3005-346\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-346\">Revolver Ocelot<\/a>, and Snake is able to escape them. On their way back to the extraction point, however, Naked Snake and Sokolov are confronted by the Boss, her former Cobra unit, as well as Colonel Volgin. The Boss explains her defection to Russia and gives Volgin portable nuclear shells as a gift. She demands that Snake give up Sokolov, but he refuses, and he is thrown off a bridge and flows downriver.<\/p><p>When Volgin, the <a href=\"\/cobra-unit\/3015-3706\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3706\">Cobra Unit<\/a>, and The Boss leave on helicopters, Volgin tests his new \"gift\" <a href=\"\/nuclear-bomb\/3055-231\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-231\">nukes<\/a> on a Soviet weapons facility. At the same time, Snake flows down river where he has sustained gruesome injuries. After he heals himself, the nuclear shell goes off in the distance, and Snake is returned to a hospital. In the hospital, Major Zero educates Snake of the United State's situation. The Soviets believed the US responsible for the nuclear shell by Volgin as an US Airforce plane was in close airspace- the one Snake <a href=\"\/parachute\/3055-504\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-504\">parachuted<\/a> out of. Lyndon B. Johnson received a phone call from Kruschev to inform him of the situation. Kruschev explains that he does not believe the US attacked, but he is under great pressure in <a href=\"\/soviet-union\/3035-507\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-507\">Soviet<\/a> government to respond. He gives Johnson two weeks for the United States to prove their innocence by taking out Volgin. Snake is ordered to return to bring back Sokolov, destroy the Shagohod, and eliminate both Volgin and The Boss.<\/p><p>After reinsertion from a jet plane, Snake returns to the hideout Sokolov was just days earlier, where a woman on a motorbike named <a href=\"\/eva\/3005-1029\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1029\">Eva<\/a> confronts him. After explaining Adam couldn't make it, and a night of desperate seduction, Snake and Eva are confronted by Ocelot and GRU soldiers once again. Eva and Snake defeat the troops, and Eva has to return to base before Ocelot, or else he may become suspicious of their internal spy. One by one, Snake defeats the Cobra Unit members, including <a href=\"\/the-pain\/3005-1053\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1053\">The Pain<\/a>, <a href=\"\/the-fury\/3005-2254\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2254\">The Fury<\/a>,<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8480\/223988-imetal_gear_solid_3_snake_eateri_20041110015920968.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-223988\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8480\/223988-imetal_gear_solid_3_snake_eateri_20041110015920968.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-223988\"><img alt=\"The Pain\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8480\/223988-imetal_gear_solid_3_snake_eateri_20041110015920968.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8480\/223988-imetal_gear_solid_3_snake_eateri_20041110015920968.jpg 400w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8480\/223988-imetal_gear_solid_3_snake_eateri_20041110015920968.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Pain\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8480\/223988-imetal_gear_solid_3_snake_eateri_20041110015920968.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/8480\/223988-imetal_gear_solid_3_snake_eateri_20041110015920968.jpg 400w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/8480\/223988-imetal_gear_solid_3_snake_eateri_20041110015920968.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The Pain<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><a href=\"\/the-end\/3005-1940\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1940\">The End<\/a>, and <a href=\"\/the-fear\/3005-1943\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1943\">The Fear<\/a>. After infiltrating the base wearing a mask disguised as a GRU Captain <a href=\"\/ivan-raidenovitch-raikov\/3005-477\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-477\">Ivan Raikov<\/a> who is friends with Volgin, Snake is found a fake by Volgin, and Sokolov is killed as Shagohod had completed production. Snake is then viciously <a href=\"\/torture\/3015-2574\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2574\">tortured<\/a>, where he learns of Volgin's \"Philosopher's Legacy\", a slush fund used by the United States, Russia, and China during <a href=\"\/world-war-ii\/3015-471\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-471\">World War II<\/a>, but Volgin's father stole it during the chaos of the war.<\/p><p>The Boss refuses to follow Volgin's orders to kill Snake, and he survives the torture - but not without losing an eye. He escapes with the help of Eva by jumping off a high ledge into a gorge below whilst being followed by attack dogs and Ocelot. In a death like dream, players must walk Snake through a river where ghosts of all the NPCs the player has killed haunts him. <a href=\"\/the-sorrow\/3005-1951\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1951\">The Sorrow<\/a>, a former member of the Cobra Unit and Boss's lover, also haunts Snake in conjunction with helping the player receive the <a href=\"\/codec\/3015-2355\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2355\">codec<\/a> code to open the prison cell doors. Snake later infiltrates the base and places C3 charges around the Shagohod. But Eva was discovered in the basement looking for the legacy by GRU, and The Boss discovers Snake's explosives. Snake then fights Volgin, where Ocelot refuses to help his comrade.<\/p><blockquote data-align=\"right\"><p>\"There is only room for one Boss... and one Snake...\"<\/p><cite>The Boss' Last Words<\/cite><\/blockquote><p>Snake and Eva then try to escape, only to have the Volgin use the Shagohod against them. Finally defeating them both in an intense boss fight, Snake and Eva escape to a plane on a lake, where Snake has to confront The Boss. She gives a speech about soldiers being pawns for war. After the long, emotional battle she describes her relationship with the Sorrow, how they had a child taken away during the invasion of Normandy, as well as when the Boss herself was ordered to kill The Sorrow during the Cold War. In a scene echoing the execution of Sniper Wolf, the player must then manually press the fire button to shoot and kill the boss. Snake and Eva then escape via WiG to an Alaskan log cabin.<\/p><p>In the morning, Snake awakes to find Eva gone as well as a monogram left. In true Metal Gear fashion, the plot is all explained at the very end. Eva tells Snake she is not an agent for the Americans or for the Russians, but for the People's Republic of <a href=\"\/china\/3035-343\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-343\">China<\/a>. Her sole objective was to retrieve the Philosopher's Legacy from Volgin, however, she was recognized by The Boss, as the Boss helped train developing spy agents. Eva explains how the Boss wanted to relay a message to Snake. The Boss in reality was not a defector to the Soviets, but an American patriot to the end. Her job was to fake defection in order to more easily infiltrate Volgin's workings. Except, when Volgin used a nuclear shell, the Soviets needed someone to blame, and that person was The Boss. The United States used The Boss as a scapegoat to avoid nuclear confrontation, and The Boss knew all along she had to die at the hands of her apprentice. Snake is disgusted by the CIA director and President as they want him to control all <a href=\"\/sneaking-mission\/3015-3406\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3406\">sneaking missions<\/a> within the CIA. After achieving the codename \"Big Boss\", Snake goes to the cemetery where The Boss lays with no name other than \"Here Lies a True American Patriot.\"<\/p><p>After the end credits roll we hear a phone conversation between Ocelot and his Russian superior informing us that he was actually a double agent working to oust Khrushchev through his activities with the GRU. A subsequent phone call with the American CIA director reveals that he was actually a TRIPLE agent by the code name ADAM, the one Snake was supposed to rendezvous with at the ruined factory. He goes on to explain that he is in possession of the Philosopher's Legacy, that the Russians have a fake, and the game ends with his mention of Granin's idea to build a bipedal tank.<\/p><h2><b>Easter Eggs<\/b><\/h2><p>In the Graniny Gorld Lab in the Lab B1 East area, on the desk of the Control Room, are several real life video game magazines including <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-2-sons-of-liberty\/3030-12388\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12388\">Metal Gear Solid 2<\/a> on the cover of one issue, <a href=\"\/zone-of-the-enders\/3030-11350\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11350\">Zone of the Enders<\/a> on the cover of PSM and <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater\/3030-18082\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18082\">Metal Gear Solid 3<\/a> on the cover of GameInformer.<\/p><p>When Snake is thrown off the bridge the player is prompted to press the \"R1\" button. If pressed the player goes into a first person view through which he can see the skeletal corpse of The Sorrow.<\/p><p>When Snake confronts Granin in his office the player is given another R1 button prompt.

Rather than being an Action game, Acid is a Turn Based Strategy and  Collectible Card game, a huge departure from the previous titles. But while the method of playing the game had changed, the fundamental gameplay had not.

With over 200 cards to collect, players have many options when it comes to constructing a deck. The cards themselves are organized into different sets, that have different themes spanning the entirety of the Metal Gear universe as well as some other games <a data-ref-id=\"3010-2057\" href=\"\/kojima-productions\/3010-2057\/\"> Kojima<\/a> has produced over the years.\u00a0 Each card has a different effect: some conjure the images of past bosses and  allies, such as <a data-ref-id=\"3005-901\" href=\"\/gray-fox\/3005-901\/\"> Gray Fox<\/a> or  Metal Gear REX to help defeat your foes, while others heal Snake, like the trusty  Ration card.

Rather, players are presented the story in a similar manner, and the game continues to expand upon the same card-strategy hybrid system of the previous title. One major change between the titles is the visuals. Where Metal Gear Acid adopted a strictly realistic direction like all previous 3D Metal Gear titles, Metal Gear Acid 2 makes use of a style that is reminiscent of comic books. Characters have thick outlines and cells of color, while retaining finer details and levels tend to have high contrasting color palettes. The series also experimented with \"3D\" images caused by two side-by-side images that create an illusion of depth in the visuals. This is accomplished in part by an accessory that was shipped with the game, the \"Solid Eye.\" The simple attachment allowed users to look at the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-18\" href=\"\/psp\/3045-18\/\">      Playstation Portable<\/a> screen through them with it separating the otherwise noticeable separation between images.<br \/><br \/>While not the last Metal Gear title on the Playstation Portable, it was the last title in the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1175\" href=\"\/metal-gear-acd\/3025-1175\/\">     Acid series<\/a>. Metal Gear Acid was followed by <a data-ref-id=\"3030-14555\" href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-portable-ops\/3030-14555\/\">       Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops<\/a>. <br \/><br \/><h2>Plot<\/h2> Metal Gear Acid opens with <a data-ref-id=\"3005-75\" href=\"\/solid-snake\/3005-75\/\">    Solid Snake<\/a> and several other characters in flight to the United States, but are apprehended by <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2906\" href=\"\/agents\/3015-2906\/\">   FBI agents<\/a> for attempting to illegally enter the country. Snake is confronted by Agent Dalton who forces Snake to investigate a suspicious weapons corporation, SaintLogic, in order to clear his name. After several missions, things begin to escalate. Players find out through a turn of events that one member of the SaintLogic team is threatening to use nuclear weapons if their demands aren't met. Like in Metal Gear Acid, players eventually get control of a second character, in this case a woman named <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6089\" href=\"\/venus\/3005-6089\/\">  Venus<\/a>.<br \/><br \/><h2>Gameplay<\/h2> Players familiar with the series will be feel at home on Metal Gear Acid 2. The <a data-ref-id=\"3015-192\" href=\"\/turn-based\/3015-192\/\"> turn-based<\/a> collectible card system has remained intact and players have over twice as many cards to collect than in the previous title. Deck construction has not changed, and cards have retained similar purposes and functions from the previous titles. This time around, players who go through the game a second time will be allowed to \"upgrade\" the packs available at the card store, allowing them to unlock many cards that were otherwise unobtainable in their first playthrough. The game once again features many \"character\" cards that come from most every title from the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-5\" href=\"\/metal-gear\/3025-5\/\">       Metal Gear<\/a> franchise, as well as other games <a data-ref-id=\"3040-63395\" href=\"\/hideo-kojima\/3040-63395\/\">       Hideo Kojima<\/a> has released over the years. These cards will feature brief video clip from their associated title as an introduction to the card whenever they are played, but none are mandatory to view.","expected_release_day":null,"expected_release_month":null,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":null,"guid":"3030-8702","id":8702,"image":{"icon_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/1789934-box_mgacid2.png","medium_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/1789934-box_mgacid2.png","screen_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/1789934-box_mgacid2.png","screen_large_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/screen_kubrick\/1789934-box_mgacid2.png","small_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/1789934-box_mgacid2.png","super_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/1789934-box_mgacid2.png","thumb_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/1789934-box_mgacid2.png","tiny_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/1789934-box_mgacid2.png","original_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/1789934-box_mgacid2.png","image_tags":"All Images,Box Art"},"image_tags":[{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-8702\/?filter=image_tag%3AAll+Images","name":"All Images","total":37},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-8702\/?filter=image_tag%3AArt","name":"Art","total":1},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-8702\/?filter=image_tag%3ABox+Art","name":"Box Art","total":3},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-8702\/?filter=image_tag%3APSP+Screenshots","name":"PSP Screenshots","total":31},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-8702\/?filter=image_tag%3AScreenshots","name":"Screenshots","total":29}],"name":"Metal Gear Ac!d 2","number_of_user_reviews":0,"original_game_rating":[{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game_rating\/3065-16\/","id":16,"name":"ESRB: M"},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game_rating\/3065-5\/","id":5,"name":"BBFC: 15"},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game_rating\/3065-28\/","id":28,"name":"CERO: 15+"},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game_rating\/3065-27\/","id":27,"name":"CERO: C"},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game_rating\/3065-13\/","id":13,"name":"OFLC: M15+"}],"original_release_date":"2005-12-08 00:00:00","platforms":[{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/platform\/3045-18\/","id":18,"name":"PlayStation Portable","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/playstation-portable\/3045-18\/","abbreviation":"PSP"}],"site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/metal-gear-acd-2\/3030-8702\/"},{"aliases":"MGS3\nMGS3S","api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game\/3030-10267\/","date_added":"2008-04-01 15:54:12","date_last_updated":"2014-05-07 17:57:01","deck":"Subsistence is an updated version of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater which contains several new features, most notably a third-person camera and an online mode, Metal Gear Online.

This page contains information about the new features included in this release.<\/p><p><b>Subsistence<\/b> added a number of features not included in the original MGS3. It was the first Metal Gear to map camera control to the right analog stick, arguably improving the gameplay. It also included the first online multiplayer component in the series, though it has since been taken off-line. The original release of the game also included ports of the original MSX versions of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6712\" href=\"\/metal-gear\/3030-6712\/\">Metal Gear<\/a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-723\" href=\"\/metal-gear-2-solid-snake\/3030-723\/\">Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake<\/a>, marking the first time these games were made available to fans outside Japan. There were some other bonus features included as well, including parodies of several cut-scenes found in the game. Due to the added content and the improved camera, Subsistence is objectively superior to the original, featuring the same superb storyline and characters while making the game-play more enjoyable.<\/p><p>Subsistence was also re-released as part of the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-15487\" href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-the-essential-collection\/3030-15487\/\">Metal Gear Solid: The Essential Collection<\/a> just prior to the launch of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20669\" href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots\/3030-20669\/\">Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots<\/a>. However, this version did not include the second or third disc and therefore lacked some of the bonus content the original release contained.<\/p><p>It was also included in the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection.

However, fans will note that the game also adds some revisions made for the GameCube remake <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-the-twin-snakes\/3030-9594\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-9594\"> Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes<\/a> which also appeared in the comic book series. The game arranges the 2D images into layers, producing the illusion of depth, while also adding motion to some of the images. It also adds music and sound effects in addition to camera pans, zooms and other associated effects to help liven up the static images. The dialog, however, is not voice-acted.<\/p><h2>Features<\/h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9247\/632329-931233_20060922_screen008.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-632329\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9247\/632329-931233_20060922_screen008.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-632329\"><img alt=\"Main Menu\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9247\/632329-931233_20060922_screen008.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9247\/632329-931233_20060922_screen008.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"><\/a><figcaption>Main Menu<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>This product is essentially only for hardcore Metal Gear Solid fans or those interested in witnessing a digital comic.

To view this feature, simply press the Circle button while in the simulation to view your percentage in addition to a heart-monitor-like meter. This meter will also reveal if Memory Elements are available. If the spikes are in the middle of the meter then that means there are elements available on that screen. If they are further toward the edges of the meter, that means that there are Memory Elements on pages further back (left) or further forward (right).<\/p><h2>Artwork<\/h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9247\/632409-931233_20060922_screen021.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-632409\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.517578125\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9247\/632409-931233_20060922_screen021.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-632409\"><img alt=\"Ashley's version of Solid Snake\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/9247\/632409-931233_20060922_screen021.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9247\/632409-931233_20060922_screen021.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/9247\/632409-931233_20060922_screen021.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/9247\/632409-931233_20060922_screen021.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/9247\/632409-931233_20060922_screen021.jpg 421w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Ashley's version of Solid Snake\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/9247\/632409-931233_20060922_screen021.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/9247\/632409-931233_20060922_screen021.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/9247\/632409-931233_20060922_screen021.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/9247\/632409-931233_20060922_screen021.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/9247\/632409-931233_20060922_screen021.jpg 421w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px\" data-width=\"421\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Ashley's version of Solid Snake<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Metal Gear Solid: Digital Graphic Novel features the artwork of Australian artist <a href=\"\/ashley-wood\/3040-29748\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-29748\">Ashley Wood<\/a>.

Multiple characters can be deployed on a mission, in the case that one falls in action. This means that failing a given scenario can only happen if players fail the primary objective or if ALL characters brought into the mission die. Any non-essential characters, such as Snake, that fall in battle are forever removed from the player's list of available soldiers to deploy. All captured enemies can be examined at the main menu to see what attributes and abilities they have. An ally's attributes represent their various skills when deployed, while special abilities may allow them to do something better than another character, on or off the field of battle.<br \/><br \/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/213780-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-213780\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0\" data-width=\"0\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a  href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/213780-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-213780\"><img alt=\"Browsing your comrades.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/213780-2.jpg\"><\/a><figcaption>Browsing your comrades.<\/figcaption><\/figure>From the main menu, players can organize their squads that they intend on deploying on missions. Alternatively though, a player can send troops to other areas to investigate and attempt to procure items. Similarly, captured scientists and engineers, as well as normal soldiers, can be assigned research detail, which will unlock new weapons and items that the player can equip on their characters. Reminiscent to the backpack menu introduced in Snake Eater, before a mission begins, players can actively choose and customize the equipment carried by each troop being deployed. This means that players must plan in advance and for any occasion before launching a mission, because they will not have access to their remaining supplies once a mission has begun. The game progresses through \"days\" on the main menu, and with each passing day, a player's research will increase if there are troops working on it and scouting parties may come back with valuable intel. It also gives the player's units time to rest and recover from previous missions. Units that see combat that are injured retain all their injuries when the mission is completed and must be healed or left to rest in order to recover an lost health.<br \/><br \/>While capturing soldiers is perhaps the easiest way to gain units, players can also attempt units by scanning and connecting to wi-fi hotspots they come across, but this can only be used once per hotspot. Similarly, players can obtain units by making use of the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-18\" href=\"\/psp\/3045-18\/\"> PSP<\/a>'s GPS Receiver, generating units depending on the player's location in the real world. Players can also trade with others through the wireless play online, as well as pit their soldiers against another player's.","expected_release_day":null,"expected_release_month":null,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":null,"guid":"3030-14555","id":14555,"image":{"icon_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/1789943-box_mgspo.png","medium_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/1789943-box_mgspo.png","screen_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/1789943-box_mgspo.png","screen_large_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/screen_kubrick\/1789943-box_mgspo.png","small_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/1789943-box_mgspo.png","super_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/1789943-box_mgspo.png","thumb_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/1789943-box_mgspo.png","tiny_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/1789943-box_mgspo.png","original_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/1789943-box_mgspo.png","image_tags":"All Images,Box Art"},"image_tags":[{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-14555\/?filter=image_tag%3AAll+Images","name":"All Images","total":575},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-14555\/?filter=image_tag%3ABox+Art","name":"Box Art","total":7},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-14555\/?filter=image_tag%3APSP+Screenshots","name":"PSP Screenshots","total":73},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-14555\/?filter=image_tag%3AScreenshots","name":"Screenshots","total":58},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-14555\/?filter=image_tag%3AStory+Mode","name":"Story Mode","total":483},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/images\/3030-14555\/?filter=image_tag%3AWallpapers","name":"Wallpapers","total":6}],"name":"Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops","number_of_user_reviews":0,"original_game_rating":[{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game_rating\/3065-21\/","id":21,"name":"BBFC: 12"},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game_rating\/3065-16\/","id":16,"name":"ESRB: M"},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game_rating\/3065-27\/","id":27,"name":"CERO: C"}],"original_release_date":"2006-12-05 00:00:00","platforms":[{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/platform\/3045-18\/","id":18,"name":"PlayStation Portable","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/playstation-portable\/3045-18\/","abbreviation":"PSP"},{"api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/platform\/3045-116\/","id":116,"name":"PlayStation Network (PSP)","site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/playstation-network-psp\/3045-116\/","abbreviation":"PSPN"}],"site_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/metal-gear-solid-portable-ops\/3030-14555\/"},{"aliases":"MGS:PO ","api_detail_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/game\/3030-19093\/","date_added":"2008-04-01 16:44:48","date_last_updated":"2013-07-05 22:38:48","deck":"Focused purely on online play, Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops Plus is a stand alone expansion to the original, Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops.","description":"<p>Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops Plus does not contain the single-player campaign that is in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-14555\" href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-portable-ops\/3030-14555\/\" slug=\"metal-gear-solid-portable-ops\">Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops<\/a>.

Your troops are divided into two groups during the Infinity Mission: Sneaking Team and the Truck Team, the Sneaking Team consists of the four active characters (i.e. Naked Snake, Gene, Null and Python) whereas the Truck Team consists of any troops you recruit during the missions; they are interchangable and can be switched around at any time.\u00a0<br\/>\u00a0The solo mission is split into a series of stages that must be completed before players are able to permenantly save data. Most stages have the same objective: Reach the goal to clear the stage\u00a0to move onto the next stage, some however require the player to fulfill certain objectives such as staying alive until the timer runs our and the final stage in each round has the player eliminating a certain number of foes (depending on difficulty). Each mission enables the player to recruit any soldier they come across, much like in Portable Ops, and after each successful stage both the Sneaking Team and the soldiers inside of the truck recieve experience points.<br\/><br\/>New additions to Portable Ops Plus include:<br\/> <\/p><ul class=\"plain-list\"> <li>Textbooks: Items which can be used to boost soldiers skills, they can be used once and only if a soldier hasn't already reached the maximum level for that skill (indicated by a white arrow)<\/li> <li>Fulton: A means of ejection, finding a fulton allows the player to eject from a mission and keep all soldiers, experience points and weapons they acquired<\/li> <li>Stealth: Whilst not new, stealth camouflage can now be found randomly whilst in a stage<\/li><\/ul><br\/><br\/>Portable Ops Plus feels more like an expansion pack than a sequel with nothing added to the story in PO.

However, MGS4 changes this by shifting the settings away from enemy bases and terrorist-occupied buildings to contested battlefields and firefights with multiple paths available to the player. Many areas are defined by a series of conflicts between PMCs and local militia. The player must think on their feet to cope with the constantly changing scenarios.<\/p><p>In addition to sneaking through a battlefield, Snake can join the surrounding firefights by aiding the militia in battle. By choosing to fight alongside the resistance, Snake can gain their trust, and receive help in the form of covering fire, ammunition and health items. However, your new allies will turn on you if they sense something suspicious, and other soldiers will immediately know if you've betrayed their comrades.<\/p><p>The camera in MGS4 is an upgraded version of the Third Person View introduced in <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-3-subsistence\/3030-10267\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-10267\">MGS3: Subsistence<\/a>, with the angle and height of the camera now able to be freely controlled. The player can also switch to First Person View at any time to assess the surrounding area, to nail a more precise shot, or to move around.<\/p><p>Unlike previous MGS games, MGS4 is broken down into a number of acts, each with a different setting. In between acts are mission briefings, which take place on <a href=\"\/otacon\/3005-150\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-150\">Otacon's<\/a> ship the Nomad. These briefings are interactive, allowing the player to change camera angles and control the <a href=\"\/metal-gear-mk-ii\/3005-1663\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1663\">Metal Gear Mk. II<\/a>, and can also be viewed again from the main menu. A new chunk of the game must be installed to the hard drive before each act - these installs are not cumulative and must be performed every time the game is replayed. The August 2012 patch allows all data to be installed at once.<\/p><h3>New Equipment<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17388\/1419318-180px_old_snake.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1419318\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56111111111111\" data-width=\"180\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 180px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17388\/1419318-180px_old_snake.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1419318\"><img alt=\"Can you see me?\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px\" data-width=\"180\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17388\/1419318-180px_old_snake.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17388\/1419318-180px_old_snake.jpg 180w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Can you see me?\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17388\/1419318-180px_old_snake.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17388\/1419318-180px_old_snake.jpg 180w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px\" data-width=\"180\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Can you see me?<\/figcaption><\/figure><p><b>OctoCamo:<\/b> A new optical <a href=\"\/\">camouflage<\/a> which allows Snake to blend into any background in a matter of seconds, rendering him invisible even to the infrared cameras mounted on the unmanned <a href=\"\/gekko\/3015-1556\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1556\">Gekko<\/a> Mechs. This is similar to the camouflage feature from MGS3, but OctoCamo works automatically, without needing to be adjusted from a menu. Special camo can be manually equipped, however, and patterns can be saved for future use. Extra patterns can be downloaded from the Extra menu. FaceCamo becomes available later and has additional preset variations that can replicate someone else's face. The player can unlock various <a href=\"\/ai-companion\/3015-143\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-143\">NPC's<\/a> faces to wear including <a href=\"\/otacon\/3005-150\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-150\">Otacon<\/a> and <a href=\"\/colonel-campbell\/3005-839\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-839\">Campbell<\/a>.

Late in the game, the Mk. II is destroyed and subsequently replaced by the Metal Gear Mk. III, which is functionally identical but has a different paint job.<\/p><h4><b>Solid Eye<\/b><\/h4><p>Another device developed by Otacon, the Solid Eye combines the capabilities of binoculars, night-vision goggles, and thermal goggles into one device, worn like an eye patch. Moreover, the Solid Eye amplifies the data collected from Snake's five senses and projects it onto Snake's field of vision. It tells Snake where the enemy is and how stable or unstable things are in battle, while also letting Snake know how easy he is to spot.<\/p><h4><b>iPod<\/b><\/h4><p>Snake is equipped with an iPod Classic which he can use to listen to music while he sneaks across the battlefield. New songs can be collected throughout the game, and downloaded from the Extra menu.<\/p><h3>Psyche Gauge &amp; Stress<\/h3><p>Similar to the Stamina gauge from MGS3, the psyche gauge represents Snake's psychological well being, which has a direct effect on his performance. The psyche gauge can be refilled with certain healing items such as noodles, while other items temporarily increase the rate at which it is replenished. The major effect of a low psyche gauge is that it will severely hamper Snake's ability to aim accurately.<\/p><p>Snake's stress level is represented by a number that appears below the psyche gauge. The stress level is affected by many factors, such as adverse weather conditions, carrying too much equipment, or Alert Phases. High stress levels can have detrimental effects on the psyche gauge and combat effectiveness.<\/p><h3>Weapons<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17388\/1419319-images__2_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1419319\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.358024691358\" data-width=\"81\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 81px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:135.8%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17388\/1419319-images__2_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1419319\"><img alt=\"Drebin\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 81px) 100vw, 81px\" data-width=\"81\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17388\/1419319-images__2_.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17388\/1419319-images__2_.jpg 81w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Drebin\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17388\/1419319-images__2_.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/17388\/1419319-images__2_.jpg 81w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 81px) 100vw, 81px\" data-width=\"81\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Drebin<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>As with all the games in the Metal Gear Solid series, the weapons play a large part of the game. The game features a massive variety of weapons ranging from handguns, sub-machine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, shotguns, rocket launchers, grenade launchers, and explosives. Each individual gun has its own characteristics including power, weight, range, <a href=\"\/close-quarters-combat\/3015-865\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-865\">CQC<\/a> compatibility, firing modes, and more. A Virtual Range option on the main menu allow the player to practice firing their acquired weapons at VR targets. It's similar in presentation to the VR training modes of previous MGS games but freeplay, rather than mission-based.<\/p><p>Weapons taken from defeated enemies are ID-locked, forcing the player to find a method for removing this lockout feature. In MGS 4, this is handled via <a href=\"\/drebin-893\/3005-474\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-474\">Drebin<\/a>. Every weapon that Snake comes across is immediately translated to Drebin points, representing its current world value in the theater of war during a given day. The more violent the conflict in the world, the more Drebin points the player receives. Players can then use these points to unlock these collected weapons for their use, or can save their points up to purchase ammunition or items in Drebin's shop, such as laser sights, hand grips and flashlights. These additional items can improve the accuracy or stability of a weapon, improving its effectiveness in combat. The Mk.II acts as your conduit to Drebin, automatically converting any weapons into Drebin Points while saving the ammunition for Snake.<\/p><h2>2.0 Patch<\/h2><p>On July 12, 2012 it was announced that MGS4 would finally receive it's long-awaited Trophy patch, as part of the Metal Gear 25th Anniversary celebrations. The 516MB patch (version 2.0) was released in all regions on August 6, 2012 and is pre-installed on retail discs going forward. 34 <a href=\"\/playstation-trophies\/3015-198\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-198\">Trophies<\/a> have been added to the game, though a brand new, post-patch save file must be started in order to earn them. Saves created with this patch are marked with \"(Ver.2)\" and are incompatible with unpatched copies of MGS4.<\/p><p>The main menu now features an \"Install\" option, which allows players to choose from a number of installation options:<\/p><ul><li><b>Individual Act Install:<\/b> As in the original release, each act installs over the previous one.<\/li><li><b>Cumulative Install:<\/b> The mid-game installs still happen, but they don't overwrite the previous one, meaning prior acts can be replayed without installing again.<\/li><li><b>Full Install:<\/b> Installs all the acts (approx. 8.5GB) at once, eliminating mid-game installs entirely.<\/li><li><b>Delete Data:<\/b> Removes any installed game data from the hard drive.<\/li><\/ul><p>In addition, Metal Gear Online has been removed from the main menu, as the service has been shut down.

To their surprise, a message from Naomi plays and explains that FOXALIVE stops everything from halting the war economy and activity to destroying all of the AI cores and stopping the Patriots completely.

Big Boss explains to Snake that none of this was his original intention. All of the nanomachines, and AI cores were misconstrued and used in evil ways that Solid Snake had stopped. Big Boss then tells Snake that he will end the last piece of the Patriots by killing Zero, and he removes his life support. He also tells Snake that the nanomachines that Drebin gave Snake killed the mutated virus and stopped Snake from becoming a biological weapon, and that he is glad that Snake's will to live was too strong to let him kill himself. However, Drebin's injection also contained a new strain of FOXDIE, which was what really killed Big Mama and Liquid Ocelot in the end, and which Big Boss has now deliberately exposed himself to.

The winner is the player with most enemy kills, either when a set amount of kills occur or when time runs out.<\/p><p><u><b>Team Deathmatch<\/b><\/u><\/p><p>Follows the rules of Deathmatch, but groups players into two teams. Every player's kills on a team are added up for that team's score.<\/p><p><b><u>Capture Mission<\/u><\/b><\/p><p>Analogous to capture the flag of other online games, with teams racing to capture and hold within their goal area assigned targets, KEROTAN or GA-KO, for a cumulative period of 30 seconds. This timer is reset when both teams have their targets in their goal area.<\/p><p><u><b>Rescue Mission<\/b><\/u><\/p><p>Similar to Capture Mission, but here, only one target, GA-KO, exists. One team defends GA-KO within their base and the other team seeks to bring it to their goal area. There is no respawning in this mode, so the team that kills all the enemy team's members automatically wins.<\/p><p><b>Base Mission<\/b><\/p><p>Structured around capturing and defending small areas scattered across the map. A team wins by seizing all the bases, or by having captured more bases than the enemy team when time runs out.<\/p><p><b>Sneaking Mission<\/b><\/p><p>Follows the rules of Team Deathmatch, but also introduces Snake, and with 11 or more players participating, Metal Gear Mk. II. The player controlling Snake wins if he acquires three dog tags from other players within the time limit. Each team can also claim victory by killing Snake a set amount of times, or by having scored more opposing team kills when time runs out.<\/p><p><u>Team Sneaking Mission<\/u><\/p><p>Demands from the sneaking team (equipped with stealth camouflage) to bring KEROTAN and \/ or GA-KO to their goal area, while the other team defends the items. A team also claims victory by stunning or killing all enemy team members.<\/p><h2>Sons of the Patriots System (SOP System)<\/h2><p>As you learn in Metal Gear Solid 4, every soldier that fights has <a href=\"\/\">nanomachines<\/a>. These nanomachines allow you to suppress pain, and also link up with teammates for better communication at teamwork. This system which allows this is called the Sons of the Patriots system (SOP). By pressing the Triangle button on your controller, you will either salute or wave to teammates, depending if you are running or not. This salute\/wave will enable you and everyone around you at the time to link up data with each other. Then, every person that teammate is linked up to is now linked up with you. Teammates gets an either orange\/red glow, or blue glow depending on if you're playing on the red or blue side. SOP is helpful for spotting teammates who are also in danger, as a little notification with an icon will come up indicating where the teammate is, and what trouble they are having. This is a great system for enabling better teamwork and communication.<\/p><h2>Skill System<\/h2><p>In Metal Gear Online, a user is allowed to use specific skills (up to 3 slots) which they can level up by using them more often. Every skill has 3 levels, each level taking up one slot (not applicable for non-lethal skills such as \"SIXTH SENSE\" where even though they have 3 levels, only one slot is needed). These skills greatly improve efficiency in gameplay mechanics, such as shooting more accurately and reloading faster with an assault rifle, performing different kinds of <a data-ref-id=\"3015-865\" href=\"\/cqccqb\/3015-865\/\">Close-Quarter-Combat<\/a> (CQC) moves, and spotting out traps such as Playboy magazines and <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1272\" href=\"\/claymore\/3055-1272\/\">claymores<\/a> before falling for them.<\/p><p>Here is the full list of current skills in Metal Gear Online:<\/p><ol><li><b>HANDGUN -<\/b> <i>Skill wielding handguns.

You can earn skills to enhance your first-person experience, such as gaining more zoom. First-person is only encouraged to be used when trying to make precision shots, but not as being used for every situation, as you will find yourself at a big disadvantage. The third-person shooting view can be accessed by pressing L1, where from there, you can change from left to right by pressing R3. While in third-person view, you can press the Triangle button on the DualShock 3\/SIXAXIS controller to enter first-person view.<\/p><h2>Playable Metal Gear Solid 4 Characters<\/h2><p>Currently, there are eight Metal Gear Solid 4 characters you can play as in this game.

Also like in the story mode, Johnny is able to soil himself. If you get three kills in a row, he will end up ducking down crapping his pants, he is immobile during this. It causes a stink trail to be left behind him, which causes the same effects as a smoke grenade. His special salute is him kneeling and shouting \"Ta-da!\" Like with Meryl, if he kills her, he will scream her name.<\/p><p><b>Liquid Ocelot<\/b><\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/85465\/1339142-product_meme_05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1339142\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56216216216216\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/85465\/1339142-product_meme_05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1339142\"><img alt=\"aka Guns of the Patriots\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px\" data-width=\"370\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/85465\/1339142-product_meme_05.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/85465\/1339142-product_meme_05.jpg 370w\"><noscript><img alt=\"aka Guns of the Patriots\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/85465\/1339142-product_meme_05.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/85465\/1339142-product_meme_05.jpg 370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px\" data-width=\"370\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>aka Guns of the Patriots<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Title: Guns of the Patriots.

If he fires at someone, it will lock up their SOP. This will stop them from firing their weapons, and if he uses its alternate function, he can destabilize enemies, they will crouch down and convulse for over 20 seconds. The downside to this is that Ocelot stays in his pose for about five seconds. He also has his Thor .45, a devastating handgun that only has one bullet in the chamber, but can knock an enemy over like a shotgun. Like Snake, he has maxed out weapon skills, and a one hit knockout slam and can reverse CQC. But unlike Snake, he has a strong punch combo, and can replace the last hit with a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3215\" href=\"\/headbutt\/3015-3215\/\">headbutt<\/a> that does more damage.

He has one of the fastest running speeds in the game, and his sword is an instant kill. Along with that, he can deflect bullets with his sword as he runs, requiring an enemy to either aim for his feet or wait for him to put his sword down. He is also able to stun enemies with the dull side of the blade. He can also jump on ledges that take two normal players to reach. He is able to use his visor to see traps. And like Johnny, he has no nanomachines, so SOP skills have no effect. Along with that, he can also fall from any distance without taking damage as long as you can survive the fall.<\/p><p><b>Vamp<\/b><\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/85465\/1339154-product_scene_06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1339154\" data-size=\"medium\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56216216216216\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/85465\/1339154-product_scene_06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1339154\"><img alt=\"aka Undead Blade\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px\" data-width=\"370\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/85465\/1339154-product_scene_06.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/85465\/1339154-product_scene_06.jpg 370w\"><noscript><img alt=\"aka Undead Blade\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/85465\/1339154-product_scene_06.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/85465\/1339154-product_scene_06.jpg 370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px\" data-width=\"370\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>aka Undead Blade<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Title: Undead Blade.

The game was released in the US on June 8, 2010. It was later remastered and ported to the <a href=\"\/xbox-360\/3045-20\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360<\/a> and <a href=\"\/playstation-3\/3045-35\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PlayStation 3<\/a> as part of the <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-hd-collection\/3030-35508\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-35508\">Metal Gear Solid HD Collection<\/a>, which was released in the US on November 8, 2011.<\/p><p>The game is set in 1974, four years after the events of <a href=\"..\/..\/metal-gear-solid-portable-ops\/61-14555\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops<\/a>, and two years after the Les Enfants Terribles project. It is based in <a href=\"..\/..\/costa-rica\/95-2231\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Costa Rica<\/a> and looks to show the creation of <a href=\"..\/..\/outer-heaven\/95-330\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Outer Heaven<\/a>. The game focuses on <a href=\"..\/..\/big-boss\/94-475\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Big Boss<\/a> and elaborates on certain elements of the Metal Gear mythology. It is being called \"The missing link in the Metal Gear Saga\" by <a href=\"..\/..\/kojima-productions\/65-2057\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kojima Productions<\/a>. <a href=\"..\/..\/hideo-kojima\/72-63395\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hideo Kojima<\/a> said he chose to focus his attention on Peace Walker rather than its console-bound brother, <a href=\"..\/..\/metal-gear-solid-rising\/61-26801\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance<\/a>, which was simultaneously in development.<\/p><p>Kojima has reiterated several times that Peace Walker is, from his perspective, \"Metal Gear Solid 5\", and, were it on the home consoles, it would have been given a numbered title. \"Since it is on PSP,\" Kojima said in an interview with Official PlayStation Magazine, \"I did not officially number it. But the game design, story, number of staff and budget-you can say that this is a big project. It would've been number 5. It\u2019s not a side story or a spin-off. It\u2019s not like Portable Ops or Acid. I am deeply involved and this is the next Metal Gear.\"<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11986\/2469554-metal-gear-solid-peace-walker.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2469554\" data-ratio=\"0.56708860759494\" data-width=\"790\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 790px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11986\/2469554-metal-gear-solid-peace-walker.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2469554\"><img alt=\"Cooperative play\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/11986\/2469554-metal-gear-solid-peace-walker.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11986\/2469554-metal-gear-solid-peace-walker.jpg 790w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/11986\/2469554-metal-gear-solid-peace-walker.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/11986\/2469554-metal-gear-solid-peace-walker.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>Cooperative play<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Despite Kojima dismissing Portable Ops, Peace Walker is a spiritual sequel to the earlier PSP title, with the recruitment feature returning and now with the inclusion of recruiting an unconscious soldier by means of a <a href=\"\/fulton-extraction-system\/3015-4675\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4675\">Fulton Recovery System<\/a>. Captured soldiers will be transported to an off-shore facility called \"Mother Base\", where soldiers will be trained and will form teams, very similar to the gameplay of Portable Ops. Each soldier has a different job and different skills, and there are thousands of unique combinations.<\/p><p>Unlike main console titles, Peace Walker's gameplay is separated into short levels termed \"stages\" as opposed to a linear progression through a large complex, as was seen in the first three Metal Gear Solid games. Players launch into stages in teams of up to four soldiers. Four player co-op gameplay is possible via the PSP's Ad-Hoc connection. There is a strong emphasis on co-operation between the players to achieve goals. Trailers for Peace Walker depict soldiers moving in a snake-like, linear, cover-based tactical movement. It was also revealed that several soldiers can hide under cardboard boxes or one box simultaneously. The player character appears as Big Boss on the user's end, while the other characters appear as generic soldiers who wear ski masks.<\/p><p>Before the start of each mission, players are able to manage to growth of Mother Base that can help Snake throughout his missions. Similar to Portable Ops, each soldier captured on the field has certain skill levels in various areas. For example, a soldier with high combat skills should be placed in the Combat Unit and soldiers with high mechanical skills should be placed into the Research &amp; Development Department and so forth.<\/p><p>There are five different departments of Mother Base that soldiers can be assigned to. The Combat Unit allows you to gain GMP and improves the combat efficiency of the soldiers between missions. The Research &amp; Development Department produces and improves weapons and items over a basic tech tree. To perform reasearch on certain items, each one has a certain criteria such as having a Medical Team at Level X and a R&amp;D Team at Level Y. Others are based on story progression whilst some involve collecting documents hidden on certain mission levels.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11986\/2469555-mgspeacew_psp_rev2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2469555\" data-ratio=\"0.56640625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.6%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11986\/2469555-mgspeacew_psp_rev2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2469555\"><img alt=\"Big Boss can perform CQC on enemies\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/11986\/2469555-mgspeacew_psp_rev2.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11986\/2469555-mgspeacew_psp_rev2.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/1\/11986\/2469555-mgspeacew_psp_rev2.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/11986\/2469555-mgspeacew_psp_rev2.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/11986\/2469555-mgspeacew_psp_rev2.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>Big Boss can perform CQC on enemies<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The Mess Hall provides food to MSF soldiers and thus affects morale. The optimal food level must be at 100%. The higher the level of the Mess Hall team the higher the percentage the level will be and as a side affect, all staff at Mother Base will enjoy a bonus to all of their skills, conversely, if the food level is below 100%, soldier's morale and skill level will drop. Ultimately, if it is too low, soldiers will defect and leave Mother Base. A high level Mess Hall team is required to create better recovery items at the R&amp;D department.<\/p><p>A Medical Team at the Mother Base's hospital cares for any staff member who happens to fall sick or is wounded in action during missions or Outer Ops. A high level Medical Team is important to prevent infectious outbreaks as well as faster recovery for anyone located in Sick Bay. Certain items like the tranquilliser gun can be improved with a high level Medical Team at the R&amp;D Department.<\/p><p>An Intelligence Team provides support for Snake and any soldier out on the field. With a higher support level, players can discover the class of the enemy soldiers that populate the mission and providing stronger support fire if players use the strike\/support marker. Lastly, there is the Brig, where hostile soldiers collected from missions are kept until their hostility dies down, whereupon they will join your army. A Trading Room is available for players willing to trade soldiers with other players.<\/p><p>Several different load outs are available before the start of each mission. The load outs are depicted as different suits Big Boss wears. On the 102nd Kojima Productions Report Podcast, it was confirmed that the different Big Bosses are part of a class system that will lend itself to whatever play-style the player chooses. From \"Battle Snake\", who is a heavy weapons class character, to a shirtless Rambo-style character called \"Naked Snake\", to an all-round character, at least four different load outs are available at all times.<\/p><p>Peace Walker features a crouch walking mechanic which first featured in <a href=\"..\/..\/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots\/61-20669\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots<\/a>. Peace Walker also takes other cues from its console counterpart; for instance, there is a new over-the-shoulder style aiming. Auto-aim features heavily in the game. Hideo Kojima has touted Peace Walker's different control-schemes heavily, which change the mapping of actions according to how the player wants to play the game. For instance, the \"action\" style choice maps the keys to make it easier to aim and fire weapons. The \"sneaking\" style does the opposite.<\/p><p>Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker features ad-hoc multiplayer only. Multiplayer modes include Team Deathmatch, Capture Mission, Base Mission, and Deathmatch. Each mode provides a variety of customizable rules and settings. Downloadable content is available and can be accessed through the extras on the title screen. DLC features include free uniform skins, additional game audio and music.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11986\/2469556-peace+walker+4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2469556\" data-ratio=\"0.37923875432526\" data-width=\"1445\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1445px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:37.9%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11986\/2469556-peace+walker+4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2469556\"><img alt=\"The cast of Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/11986\/2469556-peace+walker+4.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11986\/2469556-peace+walker+4.jpg 1445w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/1\/11986\/2469556-peace+walker+4.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/11986\/2469556-peace+walker+4.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/11986\/2469556-peace+walker+4.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The cast of Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/11986\/2469556-peace+walker+4.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/1\/11986\/2469556-peace+walker+4.jpg 1445w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/1\/11986\/2469556-peace+walker+4.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/1\/11986\/2469556-peace+walker+4.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/1\/11986\/2469556-peace+walker+4.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The cast of Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Peace Walker is set in 1974, ten years after the events of <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater\/3030-18082\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18082\">Snake Eater<\/a> and follows the story of <a href=\"\/big-boss\/3005-475\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-475\">Big Boss<\/a> (Naked Snake) at this time and explains how he became an enemy of America and the leader of the mercenary force that would later grow into <a href=\"\/outer-heaven\/3035-330\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-330\">Outer Heaven<\/a>.<\/p><p>The game opens with Snake at the base camp of his Militaires Sans Frontieres (\"Soldiers Without Borders\") where the Deputy Commander of his army <a href=\"\/master-miller\/3005-5186\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5186\">Kazuhira Miller<\/a> introduces him to Professor Ramon <a href=\"\/galvez\/3005-12515\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-12515\">Galvez<\/a> Mena and the peace-loving girl <a href=\"\/paz\/3005-12509\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-12509\">Paz<\/a> Ortega Andrade. Galvez tells Snake how he has come from <a href=\"\/costa-rica\/3035-2231\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2231\">Costa Rica<\/a> where an unknown army has infiltrated and attacked their country. Galvez wants to hire the MSF to fight this enemy as Costa Rica has no standing army. Snake assumes that the unknown army was deployed by the CIA and refuses to help Galvez and Costa Rica, and he suspects him of being a KGB agent. It is then that Galvez plays a tape recording of <a href=\"\/the-boss\/3005-478\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-478\">the Boss<\/a>. After hearing this Snake decides to take the job.<\/p><p>Snake and the MSF then relocate to an offshore oil rig off the coast of Costa Rica that will be the new home to the MSF, and call it Mother Base. Snake then infiltrates a communications outpost in Costa Rica and learns they are moving nuclear missiles through the country. He follows their trail and comes across some captured Sandinista rebels being held in an enemy camp. The de-facto leader of the rebels, <a href=\"\/amanda\/3005-12532\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-12532\">Amanda<\/a>, briefs Snake on the CIA presence and where the nukes are most likely heading. However, they are soon attacked by flying robotic kidnappers who take Amanda's brother <a href=\"\/chico\/3005-12531\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-12531\">Chico<\/a> with them.<\/p><p>Snake goes to rescue Chico, then continues following the trail of the nukes until it leads him to a base built into a crater. The nuclear missiles have been moved onto Peace Walker by the time Snake gets there, but he sees the wheelchair-bound <a href=\"\/huey\/3005-12516\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-12516\">Huey<\/a> arguing with the leader of the Peace Sentinels: <a href=\"\/hot-coldman\/3005-19910\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-19910\">Hot Coldman<\/a>. Huey is enraged that Coldman plans to use his machine to launch nuclear missiles, Coldman replies that it is necessary for Peace Walker to launch the very last nuke ever for world peace. Then Coldman then shoves him down the stairs. Snake rescues Huey from the base and continues following the trail of the Peace Walker.<\/p><p>His next stop takes him to <a href=\"\/strangelove\/3005-12862\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-12862\">Dr. Strangelove<\/a>'s AI lab, hidden in some ruins, where the AI Pod calls out Snake's real name. Strangelove demands an answer from Snake as to why he shot the Boss dead in Russia, as she based the AI off of the Boss's memories. When Snake can't give her a straight answer, she locks him in an AI pod. He manages to escape, and continues to follow her to another base located in a mining pit. However, after infiltrating the base, Snake finds that Coldman and Strangelove are both waiting for him with a lot of armed guards.<\/p><p>Soon after, Strangelove tortures Snake for an answer to her last question, but Snake refuses to say why he shot the Boss. He gets tossed in a prison cell but soon breaks out. However, Strangelove interpreted his lack of an answer as an answer in itself, and used the information to finish the AI for Peace Walker. Coldman then tells Snake he plans to launch Peace Walker's first and last nuclear strike at the MSF base, not only demonstrating its power to the world, but also poisoning the air, land and sea of Central America, giving Coldman leverage to force the people there to mass-produce Peace Walkers for him.<\/p><p>Snake leaves the base and manages to damage Peace Walker, but it transforms and powers itself across the sea to a US missile base in Nicaragua. On top of that, Coldman takes Paz hostage to ensure he won't stop them. Snake heads to the missile base anyways, but after fighting his way through a large force of guards, gets held at gunpoint by Coldman's men yet again. Coldman plans to activate Peace Walker with false data to provoke a retaliatory strike on the MSF base when Galvez shows up, revealing himself as the KGB agent Vladimir Zadornov. He forces Strangelove to retarget Peace Walker's missile at Cuba, believing that a US missile base launching a nuclear missile at Cuba will cause Communism to spread throughout South America in response.<\/p><p>Zadornov then tries to make Paz shoot Coldman. When she refuses, Zadornov shoots him anyway, but leaves him alive to enter the code. Then he announces his plan to kill Snake and turn him into a legendary martyr like \"El Che.\" However, Amanda and a force of MSF soldiers storm the base and gun down the enemy troops, taking Coldman and Zadornov as prisoners.<\/p><p>Just as disaster has been averted, Coldman uses his last breath to enter the launch codes for Peace Walker, and also transmits fake launch data to NORAD, making them think the Soviets are pre-emptively launching nuclear ICBMs all over the USA. In his view, this will force NORAD to either prove his theory right, or destroy billions of people. MSF tries to get NORAD to stand down, but Snake finds out that the only way to stop them is to destroy Peace Walker. He fires every single bullet he can at the machine and damages it, but it continues transmitting the fake data. Somehow, the Boss's AI awakens and forces Peace Walker to drown itself in the ocean, stopping the transmission for good.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/131562\/2145427-zeke.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2145427\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.70431034482759\" data-width=\"1160\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1160px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.4%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/131562\/2145427-zeke.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2145427\"><img alt=\"Metal Gear ZEKE\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/131562\/2145427-zeke.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/131562\/2145427-zeke.jpg 1160w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/13\/131562\/2145427-zeke.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/13\/131562\/2145427-zeke.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/131562\/2145427-zeke.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Metal Gear ZEKE\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/131562\/2145427-zeke.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/13\/131562\/2145427-zeke.jpg 1160w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/13\/131562\/2145427-zeke.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/13\/131562\/2145427-zeke.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/13\/131562\/2145427-zeke.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Metal Gear ZEKE<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Sometime after that, Kaz tells Snake that he's loaded the unused nuclear missiles from Peace Walker onto the Metal Gear ZEKE that Huey was developing at Mother Base in order to keep them out of the hands of others. Also, it has the effect of deterring a nuclear strike on their own base.<\/p><p>Strangely enough, Zadornov is thrown in a cell at Mother Base, but keeps escaping several times even though Snake drags him back every single time. At one point, Snake confronts Zadornov in Mother Base and shoots him dead in self-defense. He suspects that Zadornov had a double-agent in MSF help him, but just as he wonders who that could be, ZEKE begins to move. Snake rushes up to the deck of Mother Base and finds out that ZEKE was hijacked by Paz, now revealing herself as Cipher agent Pacifica Ocean. She offers Big Boss and MSF the chance to join Cipher (<a href=\"\/major-zero\/3005-476\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-476\">Major Zero<\/a>) and help them control the course of the world. Snake refuses, so Pacifica responds by planning to use ZEKE to nuke the east coast of the US, branding MSF as pariahs and inviting a retaliatory strike.<\/p><p>Snake manages to destroy ZEKE before it launches a nuke, but Pacifica ejects and falls into the ocean. It is unknown whether or not she survived. Afterwords, Kaz reveals that he knew about Paz and Galvez's real motives from the beginning, but didn't tell Snake because without them MSF would never have become the power it grew into. Snake responds that whatever happened, now they'll have to survive and evolve to face the growing threats of the times.<\/p><h2>Weapons<\/h2><p>Peace Walker, unlike other games in the Metal Gear Solid series, features a large arsenal of weapons. Weapons are separated into these categories: pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, submachine guns, sniper rifles, machine guns, and rocket launchers. A few weapons are available at the start of the game, but most of them have to be unlocked either by finding blueprints in levels or earning the blueprints by satisfying certain criteria such as completing a specific level.<\/p><p>Once the blueprints for a weapon are obtained, the weapon must then be researched before it can be used. Each weapon has different research criteria, most require the players Research &amp; Development Department to be at or above a certain level before the weapon can be researched. Some weapons also require that the Intel and\/or Medical Departments meet level criteria as well. The higher the teams department levels are above the weapons minimum requirements, the faster the weapon will be developed.<\/p><p>GMP is also needed in order to research weapons. GMP is gained by hiring soldiers to the Combat Department, and as soldiers gain experience they will provide more GMP to the total. Each weapon has a different amount of GMP required to develop the weapon, and once the weapon is done being researched the GMP required to make the weapon is returned back to the total.<\/p><p>Many weapons also have multiple ranks, the weapon's stats increase as its rank increases. If a weapon has additional ranks, once the weapon is researched the next rank can then be researched until it reaches its final rank (rank 5 is the maximum rank).<\/p><h2>Development<\/h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121483\/2774373-4630166087-27742.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2774373\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121483\/2774373-4630166087-27742.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2774373\"><img alt=\"Peace Walker was known as Metal Gear Solid 5 during development.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121483\/2774373-4630166087-27742.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121483\/2774373-4630166087-27742.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Peace Walker was known as Metal Gear Solid 5 during development.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121483\/2774373-4630166087-27742.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/121483\/2774373-4630166087-27742.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Peace Walker was known as Metal Gear Solid 5 during development.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>In an open letter handed out at Gamescom 2009, Kojima revealed further details about Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker regarding its development and content.

The collection also includes <a href=\"\/transfarring\/3015-7010\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7010\">Transfarring<\/a> support to copy saves between PS3 and handheld versions.<\/p><p>The PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game were released on Nov. 8, 2011 in North America, and the PS Vita version followed on June 12, 2012. The home console games were announced via the special MEGA64 sketch \"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=flK748GogoA\" rel=\"nofollow\">KOJIMA'S SECRET<\/a>\", aired during Konami's pre-<a href=\"\/e3-2011\/3015-6449\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6449\">E3 2011<\/a> livestream event, alongside <a href=\"\/zone-of-the-enders-hd-collection\/3030-35511\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-35511\">Zone of the Enders HD Collection<\/a>, <a href=\"\/transfarring\/3015-7010\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7010\">Transfarring<\/a> and the <a href=\"\/fox-engine\/3015-7011\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7011\">Fox Engine<\/a>.

These are the same as the versions included in MGS3: Subsistence on PS2, which in turn were based on the Japanese mobile phone ports (developed by <a href=\"\/aspect-co-ltd\/3010-1541\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1541\">Aspect Co.<\/a>). Those ports feature fully re-translated scripts, new features like Easy Mode, Boss Survival, and the Infinite Bandanna, and various gameplay tweaks. The character designs in MG2, previously based on real actors, were redrawn by Yoji Shinkawa, and many character names were changed in both games for similar reasons. Both games are presented in 4:3 aspect ratio, with no HD upgrades, scaling effects, Transfarring support or Trophies\/Achievements for this new release.<\/p><h3>Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker<\/h3><p>Peace Walker includes much of the <a href=\"\/downloadable-content\/3015-329\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-329\">DLC<\/a> made available for the original PSP version, though some real-world brands have been changed or removed.<\/p><h2>New Features<\/h2><h3>Home Versions<\/h3><p>The games have been remastered and optimized for the PS3 and 360 by <a href=\"\/bluepoint-games\/3010-6338\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6338\">Bluepoint Games<\/a> (MGS2&amp;3) and <a href=\"\/genki-co-ltd\/3010-378\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-378\">Genki Co.<\/a> (MGS:PW) and now feature a native 720p resolution at 60fps, higher-resolution textures, 16:9 widescreen, <a href=\"\/playstation-trophies\/3015-198\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-198\">Trophies<\/a>\/<a href=\"\/achievements\/3015-29\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-29\">Achievements<\/a>, and higher quality audio. Peace Walker also received remapped controls that utilize the right analog stick, plus rumble support. Cutscenes in MGS2 and MGS3 can now be viewed in full screen or a new, extended letterbox view. The collection's main menu is designed like a timeline that displays the included games in order of series chronology (MGS3, Peace Walker, MGS2) along with the year in which they take place; selecting a title brings up a summary of the plot and provides access to an unabridged digital manual.<\/p><h3>PS Vita Version<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2104\/2247279-vitacontrols.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2247279\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.466472303207\" data-width=\"343\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 343px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:46.6%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2104\/2247279-vitacontrols.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2247279\"><img alt=\"Weapon selection on PS Vita\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 343px) 100vw, 343px\" data-width=\"343\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2104\/2247279-vitacontrols.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2104\/2247279-vitacontrols.png 343w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Weapon selection on PS Vita\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2104\/2247279-vitacontrols.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/2104\/2247279-vitacontrols.png 343w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 343px) 100vw, 343px\" data-width=\"343\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Weapon selection on PS Vita<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The PS Vita version was co-developed by <a href=\"\/armature-games\/3010-6468\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6468\">Armature Studio<\/a> and although it retains some features of the 360\/PS3 versions, it's much closer to the PS2 originals in terms of resolution, frame rate and texture quality. All the MGS2 and MGS3 content present in the home console versions is carried over to PS Vita, with the exception of the new super-wide letterboxed cutscenes.<\/p><p>The handheld version introduces new touch-based controls, for actions that would normally be performed with L2\/R2\/L3\/R3 or pressure-sensitive face buttons. Touching and dragging the Item and Weapon boxes in the bottom corners of the screen allows you to scroll through the inventory; other touchscreen actions include peering around corners, zooming scopes, and zooming in on cutscenes. The rear touch pad is used for movement while in hanging or first-person view modes; holding or tapping the rear touch pad also performs a variety of functions in MGS3, such as thrusting the knife.<\/p><h3>Other Changes<\/h3><ul><li><b>360\/PS3:<\/b> Some of Peace Walker's menus and PSP-specific features were tweaked, for example \"Recruit via Hotspot\" now works based on heroism.<\/li><li><b>All:<\/b> In Japan, MGS2 HD Edition features Japanese voice acting, unlike the original version of Substance, which only included English voices.<\/li><li><b>All:<\/b> MGS2 no longer presents a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.konami.jp\/gs\/game\/mgs2_sub\/english\/ir_info\/information.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clear Code<\/a> at the end of the main game, Missions or Boss Survival.<\/li><li><b>All:<\/b> Magazines found in MGS3 now feature some newer games, including MGS HD Collection, <a href=\"\/metal-gear-rising-revengeance\/3030-26801\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26801\">Metal Gear Rising<\/a>, <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots\/3030-20669\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20669\">MGS4<\/a> and Peace Walker.<\/li><li><b>All:<\/b> In the PS2 versions of Snake Eater and Subsistence, Snake would wear an eyepatch on the title screen after beating the game once.

Xbox 360 is incompatible.<\/p><p>Peace Walker saves can be transferred between HD Edition on PS3 and the original PSP game. The process requires a PSP console connected via USB and as such the PS Vita, with it's more secure Content Manager system, is incompatible with Transfarring. There are a couple of further restrictions: Trophies can only be earned in a game started on HD Edition, and once sent to a different console the original save is either locked (PS3) or deleted (PSP), until the save is returned to that console.<\/p><p>Transfarring functionality was added to the PS3 versions of MGS2 &amp; MGS3 in patch 1.03, released alongside the PS Vita version (saves created before this patch cannot earn Trophies once Transfarred). Saves can be transferred between the PS3 and PS Vita versions either directly over local wireless or by linking to the cloud (Title User Storage). Saves sent over Wi-Fi are locked on the original console, until they're transferred back; saves that are linked to the cloud are automatically kept in sync whenever the game is saved. VR Missions and Snake Tales saves are compatible, however Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2 saves, and Photo Album data, are not.<\/p><h2>Release Info<\/h2><p>In the West, Metal Gear Solid HD Collection was released on home consoles with all three games (PS3 has one disc while 360 put Peace Walker on a second disc). In Japan, however, the package was split in two: Metal Gear Solid HD Edition (MGS2 &amp; MGS3) and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker HD Edition. Each included a <a href=\"\/downloadable-content\/3015-329\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-329\">download code<\/a> for extra content; PS3 owners got the original <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid\/3030-16140\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16140\">Metal Gear Solid<\/a> (MGS HD) and the PSP version of Peace Walker (MGS:PW HD), while 360 players received Avatar items: Metal Gear RAY and the Shagohod (MGS HD), and Tank Box and Peace Walker (MGS:PW HD). The PS Vita version does not include Peace Walker or download codes in any region.<\/p><p>Both MGS HD and MGS:PW HD was re-released under the \"<a href=\"\/greatest-hits\/3015-1644\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1644\">PlayStation 3 the Best<\/a>\" budget label in Japan on February 7th 2013.<\/p><h3>Digital Release<\/h3><p>On PS3, MGS2, MGS3 and MGS:PW are individual downloads, available separately or in discounted bundles (which vary by region). The PS Vita release is available as a single package or as individual downloads. On <a href=\"\/xbox-live-marketplace\/3045-86\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-86\">Xbox Live<\/a>, MGS2 and MGS3 are only available as a single game, and MGS:PW is a separate release.

Kojima had initially said that the game would be created by some of his younger Metal Gear team staff. During production of this game, Kojima was busy writing and directing the <a href=\"\/psp\/3045-18\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-18\">PSP<\/a> side story, <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-peace-walker\/3030-26817\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26817\">Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker<\/a>. It was announced on the Kojima Productions Report that the game will utilize a different engine than the one used in Guns of the Patriots.<\/p><p>After having trouble combining the traditional stealth gameplay of the MGS series with the Raiden's swordplay, Kojima cancelled the project, but later revived it with <a href=\"\/platinumgames\/3010-6319\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6319\">Platinum Games<\/a> as the main development studio. Platinum used their own engine to make it into a more action-oriented title, but Kojima's team at FOX Studios still held control over story and cutscene elements.<\/p><p>An<a href=\"http:\/\/www.computerandvideogames.com\/329256\/metal-gear-rising-was-cancelled\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\"> interview <\/a>with series creator Hideo Kojima confirmed that the game is considered a spin-off that is \"not part of the Metal Gear Solid series\", although it is considered part of the same universe, and thus \"canon\".<\/p><p> <\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>There are staples of gameplay from previous Metal Gear Solid titles, like the Soliton Radar and alert systems. Raiden can perform one-button stealth kills on some enemies from behind and from above if he has not been detected. Raiden even has access to a codec that can be used to communicate with his teammates for optional extra information and manually save his game.<\/p><p>However, most of the gameplay revolves around hack-and-slashing action, making use of two buttons that use Raiden's hands or feet to grip a powerful High-Frequency Sword that can cut through enemies and even some objects. Along with standard attacks is also use of a \"Free Sword Mode\" that lets the player control their slashes using the right stick and make their attacks more powerful, but limits range. Through cutting enemies in Free Sword Mode, the player can also gain <i>Zandatsu<\/i> (\"cut and take\" in Japanese) points which allows Raiden to refill his health and free sword meter by absorbing fluids from the spines of dead enemy cyborgs.<\/p><p>Like other games by developer Platinum Games the game also features a parry or blocking system, only in this game the only way to block oncoming enemy attacks is to parry the attack with a light attack in the enemies direction. Time the parry correctly and the enemy will be set up for Raiden to quickly enter into \"blade mode\" in which time slows down and Raiden is able to slice his enemy into bits and pieces in the aforementioned Free Sword Mode.<\/p><p>After each section, the player is graded on their performance including time taken, highest combo, and number of <i>Zandatsu<\/i> achieved.<\/p><h2>Story<\/h2><p>Set four years after the events of <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots\/3030-20669\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20669\">Metal Gear Solid 4<\/a>. The Sons of the Patriots (SOP) system has been destroyed by <a href=\"\/foxalive\/3015-3383\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3383\">FOXALIVE<\/a>, but the remnants of the paramilitary corporations (PMCs) still pose a threat to order in various hotspots around the globe. Private Military Security Companies (PMSC) have sprung up to help provide stability for VIPs around the world, and Raiden has joined one of them to help provide for his family while staying out of direct combat.<\/p><p>At the start of the game, Raiden is an employee of Maverick Security Consulting, Inc, a PMSC based in Colorado. He is part of a Maverick team providing security for the new Prime Minister of a developing African nation, named N'Mani. However, cyborg assassins appear out of nowhere and attack the convoy. Raiden attempts to take them out, but N'Mani is kidnapped by them.<\/p><p>Raiden follows the attackers and tries to reach the Prime Minister in time, but he ends up getting into a fight with another cyborg ninja named Samuel Rodriguez, who takes out his left eye and leaves him for dead. Maverick manages to rescue Raiden from the site but N'Mani is killed, his last words begging Raiden to destroy Desperado.<\/p><p>With the help of Herr Doktor, Maverick builds a new armored suit for Raiden and dispatches him to Sukhimi, the capital of the Russian border territory of Abkhazia. Samuel's employer, Desperado Enforcement LLC, has been instrumental in overthrowing the legitimate government of Abkhazia, and Maverick has been hired to save what's left of the country's leaders. Raiden, however, seeks revenge on Samuel for the physical and emotional scars he left on his body.<\/p><p>Nevertheless, while in Abkhazia Raiden encounters and defeats Desperado's IF Prototype LQ-84i and proceeds to send what's left to Maverick for further study. Resulting in it's eventual repair and reprogramming, to serve as a ally of sorts whom now goes by the designation of Bladewolf. After defeating the leader of stationed Desperado forces, Mistral, her client, the Abkhazian liberation extremist Andrey Dolzaev, commits suicide by blowing up a power pylon with himself on it.<\/p><p>Raiden is then instructed by Maverick to head to Guadalajara alongside Bladewolf, to investigate a research facility with a potential Desperado tie. There he meets an orphan named George whose brain was going to be extracted alongside several other children for a nefarious purpose. The facility was inspected by an elite member of Desperado named Sundowner alongside a Senator from Colorado and backer of World Marshal PMC named Steven Armstrong. It's revealed that the two PMCs plan to place the extracted orphans brains into cybernetic bodies as a way to create a new breed of obedient slave soldiers.<\/p><p>Raiden proceeds to rescue George and the other orphans, and rushes back to Colorado to deal with World Marshal. Raiden abruptly resigns from Maverick to keep any potential fallout off his company as he plans to undergo a solo raid in Denver, massacring several DPD cops and Desperado soldiers in the process. Maverick still decides to aid Raiden, albeit unofficially.<\/p><p>Throughout his battles, Raiden becomes conflicted with his actions however and starts turning into his \"Jack The Ripper\" persona after encountering Samuel once again alongside his comrade Monsoon in front of World Marshall's Denver facility. Raiden unleashes his Jack the Ripper persona to kill Monsoon while Samuel leaves to report back to Armstrong. When confronting Sundowner, however Raiden learns that Armstrong was using Desperado to hold off Raiden while he started Operation Tecumseh; through this terrorist act Armstrong attempts to murder the President of the United States while he is doing peace talks in Pakistan to ensure his ultimate goal of another War on Terror.<\/p><p>Unable to get any direct help from Maverick, Raiden decides to turn to a company by the name of Solis to get to Pakistan in time to thwart the Senator's treasonous plot. Raiden is stopped however by Samuel in the Badlands and the two have their final duel. Following Raiden's victory he continues to Solis to find help from an old friend, Sunny Emmerich who now works for Solis and helps him reach the Pakistani air base. Raiden arrives in Pakistan and stops Armstrong who is piloting the new Metal Gear Excelsus.<\/p><p>Excelsus is then eventually destroyed by Raiden, yet Armstrong himself ends up being more of a challenge, almost too much for Raiden to handle alone in single combat even. So before being abruptly defeated and killed by Armstrong's raw nano-machine fueled strength, Bladewolf brings Raiden Samuel's sword which he uses to finally finish off Armstrong for good.<\/p><p>With Armstrong's plan now thwarted and Desperado also in ruins, World Marshall is all that remains between Raiden and a resolution. Raiden opts not to return to Maverick and to instead work alone, fighting his own personal war now. He is also seen in a more human form with a red left eye, hinting that Maverick managed to have his old human-like cyborg body rebuilt for him, and had his left eye fully replaced with a cybernetic one.

Hideo Kojima came on stage and then \"passed the torch\" to Rising's producer, Shigenbu Matsuyama. He then explained that the game is based on \"Zan-Datsu\". In Japanese, \"Zan\" (\u65ac) means \"to cut\" and \"Datsu\" (\u596a) means \"to take by force\". Then a trailer was shown. The first part of the trailer showed Raiden infiltrating an enemy base and cutting a rather beefy cybernetic enemy to shreds, apparently absorbing energy of some kind from a dismembered segment of one of the robot's two spines. Then the trailer showed actual gameplay footage, in which the player takes control of Raiden and fights through a village similar to the one found in chapter two of Metal Gear Solid 4. The gameplay from the trailer suggests that Rising is far more focused on action, combat, and melee than the previous Metal Gear Solid games. Also, from the trailer, it looks like the player will be able to control how Raiden uses his sword in different ways, ranging from gorily and efficiently dismembering his opponents to benignly chopping a <a href=\"\/watermelon\/3055-590\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-590\">watermelon<\/a> (a reference to the famous scene from MGS4 in which a <a href=\"\/gekko\/3015-1556\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1556\">Gekko<\/a> confuses a box full of watermelons for Old Snake) into handy slices.<\/p><h3>Platinum Games Takes Over<\/h3><p>In spite of numerous plot ideas and a variety of scenarios thought out for the game, Kojima Productions was still finding it extremely difficult to design a game mostly around the inherent concept of cutting things. The project was silently cancelled in late 2010 due to lack of foreword momentum and whilst Kojima had considered moving the project to developers abroad, mainly of a Western nature he felt that a Japanese developer would still be more suited to produce a sword focused, ninja action game. In early 2011, Kojima chose to approach <a href=\"\/tatsuya-minami\/3040-26740\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-26740\">Tatsuya Minami<\/a>, president &amp; CEO of <a href=\"\/platinumgames\/3010-6319\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6319\">Platinum Games<\/a> about reviving the cancelled project with them. Platinum Games accepted the challenge and took over development with <a href=\"\/atsushi-inaba\/3040-40595\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-40595\">Atsushi Inaba<\/a> as producer, reworking the game from the bottom up using their own engine, whilst Kojima Productions handling cutscenes and story elements, revising the story to now take place after Metal Gear Solid 4 to reflect the new development style. This new revision, now given the title Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, was first revealed via a trailer initially intended to exclusively premiere on the Spike Video Game Awards on December 10, 2011 though it was leaked online hours before its scheduled appearance.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118712\/2091276-175e77c1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2091276\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.56071152358855\" data-width=\"1293\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1293px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118712\/2091276-175e77c1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2091276\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/118712\/2091276-175e77c1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118712\/2091276-175e77c1.jpg 1293w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/11\/118712\/2091276-175e77c1.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/118712\/2091276-175e77c1.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/118712\/2091276-175e77c1.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/118712\/2091276-175e77c1.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/11\/118712\/2091276-175e77c1.jpg 1293w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/11\/118712\/2091276-175e77c1.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/11\/118712\/2091276-175e77c1.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/11\/118712\/2091276-175e77c1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>The VGA reveal trailer has also revealed that Raiden will once again be voiced by <a href=\"\/quinton-flynn\/3040-34971\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-34971\">Quinton Flynn<\/a>, who had been previously quoted, saying Konami had yet to contact him regarding the game.

For one, there is no longer a radar system to help the player view enemy placement and the surrounding environment. Instead, players must use Snake's binoculars to mark enemies, vehicles, and other points of interest. Once marked, players can view and track each element's position on the HUD, as well as seeing the outlines of nearby enemies through walls. The binoculars also include a directional microphone that allows the player to listen to far-off conversations. The player can also hit a button and have Kaz provide information on anything that the binoculars are pointed at, providing additional backstory about the base and its soldiers.<\/p><p>Another new mechanic is the reflex mode. If the player is spotted by an enemy, the game will go into slow motion for around five seconds; this gives the player an opportunity to take down the guard that spotted him\/her before other guards are alerted. If the player fails to kill or incapacitate this guard, the entire base will enter alert status and soldiers will begin to converge on the player's position.<\/p><p>Snake has most of the moves players are accustomed to from previous games, though there are several differences. Snake can aim in all directions while prone by rotating his body, as well as perform a combat dive to get out of sticky situations and into nearby cover. Snake will automatically stick to walls and low cover completely removing the need to keep holding the directional button in order to stay hidden. He can also use <a href=\"\/close-quarters-combat\/3015-865\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-865\">CQC<\/a> from cover and disarm enemies by using the correct order of button presses.<\/p><p>During a mission, Snake can drop a flare grenade to signal a helicopter that can be used to retrieve hostages or abort the mission. After the landing zone is selected the helicopter plays a tune chosen by the player when approaching (e.g Heavens Divide or Ride of the Valkyries), though if the tune is too loud, or if the helicopter is too close to enemies, it can be shot down. It can also trigger a full alert status on the base depending on the chosen landjng zone but will not penalize the player\u00b4s stealth ranking, because enemies have spotted the helicopter and not Snake.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/89459\/2307936-1droid.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2307936\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/89459\/2307936-1droid.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2307936\"><img alt=\"The iDroid Device\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/89459\/2307936-1droid.png\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/89459\/2307936-1droid.png 1280w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/8\/89459\/2307936-1droid.png 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/89459\/2307936-1droid.png 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/89459\/2307936-1droid.png 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The iDroid Device\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/89459\/2307936-1droid.png\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/89459\/2307936-1droid.png 1280w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/8\/89459\/2307936-1droid.png 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/89459\/2307936-1droid.png 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/89459\/2307936-1droid.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The iDroid Device<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Snake also carries with him an iDroid, a <a href=\"\/hologram\/3015-3695\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3695\">holographic projection<\/a> device that is used to display the map and mission information, as well as allowing him to call in for a helicopter to rescue both prisoners or to extract himself from the base\u2014all of this taking place outside of the pause menu in real time.<\/p><p>The game also features day\/night cycles which enhance replay value by mixing up enemy patrol patterns as well as altering how far away guards will spot you, which in turn forces you to play differently.<\/p><p>Knocking on walls is no longer possible, but players can throw empty magazines in order to replicate the effect.

He then tries to convince Paz to talk as well, but to no avail.<\/p><p>After enduring more torture, Paz eventually reveals the location of Cipher to Skull Face, who plans to eliminate him once and for all. His reasons for wanting this are not revealed.<\/p><p>Kaz and Snake are both worried that Paz might reveal the truth about <em>MSF<\/em> and Metal Gear ZEKE. To complicate matters further, the UN (with US forces) is due to inspect Mother Base for nuclear weapons in order to determine whether or not MSF poses a real threat to the world.<\/p><p>This inspection is forced upon them by <a href=\"\/huey-emmerich\/3005-12516\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-12516\">Huey Emmerich<\/a>, who, behind Kaz's and Boss' back, reached out to the UN and retracted Boss' initial response to \"respectfully decline\" the inspection.

This recording, a final \"request\" from Skull Face to Chico, raises red flags and clearly signifies a trap.<\/p><p>Snake is forced to infiltrate the prison camp to rescue both Paz and Chico. All he can hope is that Chico is still alive and that Paz can be recovered for questioning. Unfortunately, the inspection team will be arriving the night he leaves for the prison camp, and Kaz warns Snake that he will be on his own without MSF backup for this mission.<\/p><p>Snake arrives quietly at the base and manages to rescue Chico, who becomes terrified and aggressive upon seeing Snake. Snake subdues Chico and carries him to the extraction point. Before Chico is extracted, he remarks that Paz is dead and gives Snake a cassette tape to prove it\u2014this tape is a recording of Paz's torture and supposed death. Listening to the tape, Snake uses audio clues to deduce where Paz is being held and makes his way to the boiler room of the prison camp. There he finds Paz still alive and bound in chains. Snake frees her and carries her out for evacuation via helicopter. While en route to Mother Base, it is discovered that a live bomb was surgically implanted into Paz's abdomen by removing some of her organs in order to fit; it is promptly removed by the medic inside the helicopter and thrown into the sea by Snake.<\/p><p>Snake arrives back at Mother Base to find it under heavy attack\u2014the inspection team was actually a ruse designed to give an enemy assault force access to the base. Snake attempts to rally his forces and fight back, but he is forced to extract with Kaz and fly away as the base explodes and crumbles into the ocean. Kaz is visibly shaken after witnessing the loss of Mother Base and lashes out at Paz, who he sees as the main culprit\u2014he does not yet know that it was in fact Chico that gave XOF the intelligence about Mother Base. Snake and the others are closely pursued by enemy helicopters, which seem to be under the orders of XOF.<\/p><p>Paz then awakes and stands up in fright, stating that there is a bomb implanted in her body. Snake tries to calm her down by saying that it had been removed, but as this is being said Paz opens the door and reveals that an additional bomb was also implanted inside of her. She then throws herself out of the chopper in an attempt to save Snake and the others, but the bomb goes off when she is just outside the door, causing the chopper to lose control and collide with a pursuing enemy helicopter.

The trailer was as much of a reveal of Ground Zeroes as it was for FOX Engine.

Project Ogre was later revealed to be Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain.<\/p><h2>Reception<\/h2><p>Ground Zeroes received overall positive reviews, averaging <a href=\"http:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/game\/playstation-4\/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes\" rel=\"nofollow\">75<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/game\/xbox-one\/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes\" rel=\"nofollow\">76<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/game\/pc\/metal-gear-solid-v-ground-zeroes\" rel=\"nofollow\">80 <\/a>Metacritic scores for the Playstation 4, Xbox One, and PC versions of the game respectively. The game was praised consistently for its graphical fidelity and gameplay mechanics, providing an immersive espionage experience: \"[w]ith Ground Zeroes\u2019 minimal HUD, a narrow third-person camera angle, and a sprawling base filled with potential threats, sneaking behind enemy lines has rarely felt so tense and immersive,\" <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/reviews\/metal-gear-solid-5-ground-zeroes-review\/1900-6415701\/\">said Gamespot staff member Peter Brown in his March 18, 2014 review<\/a>. The game was also praised by some outlets for its exploration of various political themes, particularly the imprisonment of war criminals in \"black site\" prison camps akin to Camp Omega. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2014\/mar\/20\/metal-gear-solid-5-ground-zeroes\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reviewer Rich Stanton elaborated on this point in his March 20, 2014 Guardian review<\/a>: \"...as the repeating structure and evolving narrative are at pains to point out, black sites like this and their grey legal status are a tribute to bureaucracy's unerring ability to triumph over ethics and what is 'right' - just ask President Obama. If Kafka was alive today he'd be writing about Guantanamo, but instead we have Hideo Kojima and an irony; a medium predicated on interaction, a game about tactical espionage action, with an overarching theme of political inaction.\"<\/p><p>The overarching criticism of Ground Zeroes was the length of its primary story-based mission, which could be completed in less than one hour. This led many to compare the game to a playable demo, which, when paired with its original price point of $40, led many to label the game as a \"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.polygon.com\/2014\/3\/18\/5519578\/metal-gear-solid-5-ground-zeroes-review\" rel=\"nofollow\">cash grab<\/a>.\" <a href=\"http:\/\/www.escapistmagazine.com\/articles\/view\/video-games\/editorials\/reviews\/11133-Metal-Gear-Solid-V-Ground-Zeroes-Review-Snake-Oil.2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reviewer Jim Sterling stated the following in his Escapist Magazine review<\/a>: \"The problem is, <em>Ground Zeroes<\/em> truly, honestly, does not feel like much of a game. Not a complete one. Not a full product, worthy of charging money.\" Konami responded to these criticisms on February 24, 2014 by reducing the cost of the Playstation 4 and Xbox One versions of the fame to $30, which was equivalent to the price tags of the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 versions.<\/p>","expected_release_day":null,"expected_release_month":null,"expected_release_quarter":null,"expected_release_year":null,"guid":"3030-39575","id":39575,"image":{"icon_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/square_avatar\/2578540-mgsvgz.png","medium_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_medium\/2578540-mgsvgz.png","screen_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/screen_medium\/2578540-mgsvgz.png","screen_large_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/screen_kubrick\/2578540-mgsvgz.png","small_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_small\/2578540-mgsvgz.png","super_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_large\/2578540-mgsvgz.png","thumb_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/scale_avatar\/2578540-mgsvgz.png","tiny_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/square_mini\/2578540-mgsvgz.png","original_url":"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/api\/image\/original\/2578540-mgsvgz.png","image_tags":"All

The Metal Gear Online mode, developed separately by new studio <a href=\"\/konami-los-angeles-studio\/3010-10605\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-10605\">Konami Los Angeles<\/a>, was released as an update on October 2015 (for consoles) and January 2016 (for the PC).

Unlike previous franchise installments, The Phantom Pain focuses on non-linear gameplay progression spread across two primary <a href=\"\/open-world\/3015-207\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-207\">open world<\/a> environments while adding a variety of tactical options to support Snake's operations in the field. New features include <a href=\"\/enemy-tagging\/3015-4794\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4794\">marking enemies<\/a> on the player's HUD by using a pair of custom binoculars (effectively replacing the <a href=\"\/radar\/3015-3542\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3542\">radar system<\/a> of previous installments) and the Support Buddy system which allows Snake to bring along unique AI-controlled characters on field missions for additional combat or intelligence support.<\/p><h3>Stealth &amp; Combat<\/h3><p>The basic gameplay in The Phantom Pain follows the series' overhauled stealth and combat mechanics established in Ground Zeroes. If the player is detected by an enemy they will activate a \"reflex mode\": the game will enter slow motion and allow the alerted guard to be dealt with without sounding an alarm. If the player fails to take the guard down the game will instantly enter an alert state, with entire area converging on the player's position. Reflex mode can be turned off in the options menu for higher difficulty. Marked enemies become visible through walls and can be tracked using the <a href=\"\/idroid\/3055-6151\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-6151\">iDroid's<\/a> map function.<\/p><p><a href=\"\/close-quarters-combat\/3015-865\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-865\">CQC<\/a> returns with more options: players can hold up guards, stun one or more enemies in rapid succession, cover take-downs and a ledge grab maneuver. Information on ammo caches and guard locations can be found by interrogate subdued guards.<\/p><h3>Mother Base<\/h3><p>Similar to the one found in Peace Walker is the player created <a href=\"\/mother-base\/3035-4097\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-4097\">Mother Base<\/a> in which the player is able to build, customize and research upgrades for their weapons and call in for supply drops (including suppressors) in the field.<\/p><p>The player's base will be akin to a hub area where Snake can interact with main story characters and will be an important part of the multiplayer aspect of the game that focuses on attacking and stealing resources from other players' bases as well as making sure that the player's own is defended well enough with weapon emplacements, automated turrets and patrolling guards.<\/p><h3>Support Buddy System<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/129018\/2703265-1411184745704.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2703265\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/129018\/2703265-1411184745704.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2703265\"><img alt=\"D-Dog ready for combat\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/129018\/2703265-1411184745704.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/129018\/2703265-1411184745704.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/12\/129018\/2703265-1411184745704.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/129018\/2703265-1411184745704.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/129018\/2703265-1411184745704.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"D-Dog ready for combat\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/129018\/2703265-1411184745704.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/129018\/2703265-1411184745704.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/12\/129018\/2703265-1411184745704.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/129018\/2703265-1411184745704.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/129018\/2703265-1411184745704.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>D-Dog ready for combat<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>New to the series is the Support Buddy System, where players can recruit special allies (each with their own unique abilities) that can accompany them on missions.

Leaving this area before all objectives are complete will result in the player having to re-accept and restart the scenario.<\/p><p>The game environment is more interactive; Snake can now rock-climb, perform a combat roll as well as lunge forward a short distance to lower his profile and avoid detection. Some areas will also have native fauna that is hostile such as wolf packs that may interfere with the players actions if not avoided or taken into account, some camouflaged making detection harder. Weather effects will also play a role in the gameplay with sandstorms and torrential rain, reducing both guard detection and player visibility.<\/p><p>In order to traverse large maps vehicles have been introduced such as jeeps, tanks and the support buddy D-Horse. The player can also call in a helicopter to extract him out of missions, the helicopter however can be shot down if it is called to a heavily fortified enemy location.<\/p><h3>Fulton Extraction &amp; Recruitment<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/86603\/2644271-sheep.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2644271\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"800\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/86603\/2644271-sheep.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2644271\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/86603\/2644271-sheep.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/86603\/2644271-sheep.jpg 800w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/86603\/2644271-sheep.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/86603\/2644271-sheep.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/86603\/2644271-sheep.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/8\/86603\/2644271-sheep.jpg 800w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/8\/86603\/2644271-sheep.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/8\/86603\/2644271-sheep.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/fulton-extraction-system\/3015-4675\/\">Fulton Extraction System<\/a> returns from <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-peace-walker\/3030-26817\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26817\">Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker<\/a>, allowing for the capture and recruitment of enemy combatants and abduct supplies caches, animals and vehicles from the open world map. These serve the function of improving and upgrading the new Mother Base. Unlike Peace Walker, the Fulton is not foolproof in this game: it can be shot down by enemy soldiers if they are alerted to its presence, and weather conditions can lessen the chance of a successful recovery. Items or enemies extracted during adverse conditions can be lost and never be recovered. The only 100% successful method of extraction is evacuating individuals by helicopter, like in Ground Zeroes, ensuring the Fulton balloon is not blown off course. However, the same risks inherent in doing so, such as the chopper being shot down and only being able to land in certain areas, are still present here.<\/p><p>Character stats return from <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-portable-ops\/3030-14555\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14555\">Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops<\/a>, enemy soldiers the player recruits will have randomized stats ranging from sneaking and deployment to intelligence gathering and recon.

Despite still being bedridden, Big Boss survives the attempt on his life with the assistance of a mysterious bandaged patient calling himself \"Ishmael\".<\/p><p>After evading the soldiers and a powerful <a href=\"\/fire-manipulation\/3015-2743\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2743\">pyrokinetic<\/a> entity known only as \"The Man on Fire,\" Big Boss and Ishmael manage to escape the hospital, but Ishmael disappears after their vehicle crashes through a roadblock.

Big Boss follows closely behind and confronts Huey in his lab, where he black-bags him and tries to exfiltrate, only to run into Skull Face standing on a new, working Metal Gear called the Sahelanthropus that was somehow completed without Huey's help. Big Boss manages to escape from the area after shooting down the new Metal Gear with his chopper's gatling gun.<\/p><p>Back at Mother Base, Miller and Ocelot torture Huey for answers, as Miller is convinced that Huey sold out the MSF to Cipher back in Cuba, while Huey claims innocence. Eventually, Ocelot manages to get an answer out of Huey, that Cipher was heading towards central Africa to make \"a weapon to surpass Metal Gear,\" so Big Boss and Miller decide to expand the Diamond Dogs operation there as well.<\/p><p>Snake's first mission in Africa involves destroying an old oil refinery to stop the leak of oil into fresh water, but before he does, he notices strange bodies bubbling up from the oil at the facility. On top of that, Miller uncovers a scheme by Cipher to provide Soviet-owned Walkers and even radioactive \"yellowcake\" to US-backed Afrikaner mercenaries, but he is unsure of the endgame.<\/p><p>Later, Big Boss infiltrates a diamond mine to find child slaves working there. Instead of eliminating them for his contract, he decides to rescue them, and considers training them into soldiers for the Diamond Dogs. However, Miller vetoes the idea, instead having them study and do basic jobs on Mother Base. As Big Boss deals with rescuing more child soldiers, he encounters a bloody hospital with several prisoners covered in diseased cysts and being forced to listen to recordings in foreign languages. However, he is attacked by The Man on Fire again and barely escapes as the facility is burned to the ground.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/129563\/2785714-mgs5-white-mamba.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2785714\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/129563\/2785714-mgs5-white-mamba.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2785714\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/129563\/2785714-mgs5-white-mamba.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/129563\/2785714-mgs5-white-mamba.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/12\/129563\/2785714-mgs5-white-mamba.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/129563\/2785714-mgs5-white-mamba.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/129563\/2785714-mgs5-white-mamba.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/129563\/2785714-mgs5-white-mamba.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/129563\/2785714-mgs5-white-mamba.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/12\/129563\/2785714-mgs5-white-mamba.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/129563\/2785714-mgs5-white-mamba.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/129563\/2785714-mgs5-white-mamba.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>While rescuing child soldiers, Big Boss encounters a surprisingly strong white boy named Eli, and takes him back to Mother Base, though he refuses to go peacefully. Suddenly, disease begins to break out on Mother Base, with Ocelot thinking that this parasitic bio-weapon is what Cipher sought. As multiple DD soldiers get sick and even die, Big Boss races against time to find someone who can stop the parasites. Following a string of captured intel agents, Big Boss heads for an old mansion, fighting his way past a quartet of Skulls snipers like Quiet.<\/p><p>In the basement of the mansion, he discovers an old Navajo parasite researcher called Code Talker, who tells him that the parasites attach to the vocal chords of those speaking a certain language and grow until they kill the host. On top of that, there is a separate strain of the same parasite that turns humans into the Skulls that Big Boss fought before, but at the cost of their voice. Skull Face stole Code Talker's research and used it to create the \"weapon to surpass Metal Gear.\" Miller and Ocelot determine that the experiments at the Devil's House were made to train the parasites to infect and kill everyone that didn't speak English.<\/p><p>After escaping by chopper, Code Talker tells Big Boss that he has a microbe that can cure those with the infection, but at the risk of rendering them infertile. However, the parasites were only part of Skull Face's plan. As Big Boss mentions the truck transporting radioactive yellowcake, the chopper is shot down over the airfield, forcing Big Boss to kill more Skulls soldiers before another chopper can be dispatched to pick them both up.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/129563\/2785713-codetalker.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2785713\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/129563\/2785713-codetalker.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2785713\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/129563\/2785713-codetalker.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/129563\/2785713-codetalker.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/12\/129563\/2785713-codetalker.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/129563\/2785713-codetalker.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/129563\/2785713-codetalker.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/129563\/2785713-codetalker.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/129563\/2785713-codetalker.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/12\/129563\/2785713-codetalker.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/129563\/2785713-codetalker.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/129563\/2785713-codetalker.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>On the second chopper back, Code Talker and Ocelot put together the pieces of Skull Face's plan: to spread Walker Gears across the globe with mini-sized nuclear material that could be acquired for relatively-low cost, which could later be instantly refined using \"metallic archaea\" into weapons-grade nukes, completely eliminating the advantage of nation-states. On top of that, Skull Face would be able to control all the new Walker Gears, and secretly use them to spread the parasites, essentially taking over the world in one fell swoop.<\/p><p>Back at Mother Base, Skull Face helps the Diamond Dogs cure the quarantined soldiers who spoke in Kikongo. Soon after, Ocelot and Miller decide to torture Huey again for the location of the repaired Sahelanthropus before Skull Face reveals it to the world and kickstarts his plan. Huey reveals that the machine is located back in Afghanistan, in a place called OKB Zero, so Big Boss decides to head back there to destroy the Sahelanthropus again.<\/p><p>Big Boss infiltrates the military base as Miller notes that the entire place is crawling with XOF soldiers who have killed all the Soviet soldiers stationed there. Huey notes that the Sahelanthropus is missing as Big Boss makes it to a helipad where he finds Skull Face and several XOF soldiers waiting for him. Finding himself outmatched, Big Boss takes a ride with Skull Face and XOF through Kabul.<\/p><p>As they travel through Soviet territory, Skull Face tells Big Boss of the history between himself, Zero, and Cipher before revealing the last piece of his plan: a strain of the vocal chord parasite that will kill all English-speakers. Instead of <em>lingua franca<\/em>, the world will be united under the fear of each other's Metal Gear. Finally, the XOF convoy arrives at the power plant where Big Boss see the finished Sahelanthropus.

Big Boss and Miller proceed to shoot Skull Face multiple times with his own gun, before Huey decides to fire the last shot into his head.<\/p><p>Back at Mother Base, the Diamond Dogs pay tribute to their fallen brethren as several choppers transport the wrecked Sahelanthropus to the main R&amp;D Platform.

Ocelot offers to interrogate him, but Miller vetoes the idea, instead asking Big Boss to continue rescuing the kids before they wind up dead on the battlefield.<\/p><p>Big Boss rescues the children and brings them back to Mother Base, where Ocelot is interrogating Eli about his threat, when the Floating Boy appears and somehow manages to activate the supposedly broken Sahelanthropus. Eli hops into the pilot's seat of the Metal Gear, then escapes with his fellow child soldiers.<\/p><p>To make matters worse, the body of the Man on Fire explodes, causing a radiation leak on the Quarantine Platform. The radiation mutates the dormant parasites in the bodies of the Mother Base cleanup crew, forcing Big Boss to go in and kill them all before they can escape outside and spread the evolved parasites to the world. Despite Huey's objections, Big Boss holds a ceremony where the ash from the cremated bodies of the infected are then turned into diamonds, that will be carried into battle by the Diamond Dogs.<\/p><p>In light of these recent events, Miller holds a show trial for Huey, providing evidence that Huey not only repaired the Sahelanthropus against Big Boss's orders using the child soldiers, but even sealed the missing Dr. Strangelove in one of her AI Pods until she suffocated. While Miller and the soldiers call for blood, Big Boss decides instead to exile Huey from Mother Base in a life raft.<\/p><h3>A Quiet Exit<\/h3><p>Some time afterwards, Quiet goes missing from the base into Soviet territory in Afghanistan. Code Talker reveals that she had been infected with the strain of English vocal chord parasites, but she had apparently taken a vow of silence so as not to endanger Big Boss or Mother Base. However, after the incident on the quarantine platform, she became afraid that her silence would not be sufficient to prevent another parasite outbreak and decided to part ways. Even so, Big Boss went to rescue her.<\/p><p>Despite being clothed and almost raped by Soviet soldiers, Quiet breaks herself out of captivity just as Big Boss arrives to help. The two of them are then forced to fight off a Soviet armored column by themselves, but one last tank manages to fire a shell at their position before going down. Big Boss tries to evac Quiet, until a sandstorm and a venomous snake strike leave them both nearly dead. Running low on time, Quiet decides to speak English and call down the Pequod on their position. Shortly before wandering off somewhere in the Afghan wilderness, she leaves behind a cassette tape apologizing to Big Boss for her actions.<\/p><h3>Truth: The Man Who Sold The World<\/h3><p>After fulfilling certain gameplay requirements, the Phantom Pain's final story mission becomes available. Here it is revealed that the game's playable character Venom Snake is not, in fact, the original Big Boss. The man now known as \"Venom Snake\" is shown to be the field <a href=\"\/doctor\/3015-2527\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2527\">medic<\/a> on board the extraction helicopter who removed the first bomb from Paz's abdomen during the ending of Ground Zeroes. Although the true Big Boss also survived the helicopter crash, he and the medic both fell into comas that would last until early 1984.<\/p><p>During this time, Zero had arranged for Big Boss and the medic to be relocated to the British military hospital in Cyprus in order to continue their medical treatment, as well as to hide both men from Skull Face and his XOF unit. Zero also contacted Ocelot to have him serve as head of security for the hospital, explaining his plan for Ocelot to groom the comatose medic as a \"phantom\" body double who would pose as Big Boss once he had awoken. This would allow the genuine Big Boss to maintain a low profile and evade XOF or anyone else who wanted him dead.<\/p><p>Thanks to Ocelot's <a href=\"\/hypnosis\/3015-2575\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2575\">hypnosis<\/a> regimen, the medic was able to nearly completely assume Big Boss' personality traits and past experiences. Combined with extensive plastic surgery, the medic totally discarded his former identity to become Big Boss both mentally and physically, truly believing himself to be the legendary mercenary. Venom's mysterious benefactor \"Ishmael\" in Cyprus was the real Big Boss all along; after their ambulance had crashed through the XOF roadblock, Big Boss fled the area with Ocelot's help, swapping identities with the medic before striking off on his own to lay the groundwork for a new independent nation of mercenaries that would eventually become <a href=\"\/outer-heaven\/3035-330\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-330\">Outer Heaven<\/a>. Ocelot remained near the crashed ambulance until the medic regained consciousness so that he could escort the newest member of Diamond Dogs to Afghanistan as \"Venom Snake\".<\/p><p>Years later, after countless battles fought alongside his mercenary comrades, Venom begins to remember who he was before the original Mother Base's destruction. He receives an <a href=\"\/audio-cassette\/3055-4054\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-4054\">audio cassette<\/a> sent from the real Big Boss labelled \"From the Man Who Sold the World\". Playing the cassette tape, Venom hears the voice of Big Boss, who confirms Venom's true purpose as his double. However, Big Boss also states that despite their deception, both men are now effectively \"Big Boss,\" having built their legend together.<\/p><p>Venom ejects the cassette and flips it over to view the reverse side labelled \"Operation Intrude N313\" before inserting it into a cassette drive attached to an <a href=\"\/msx\/3045-15\/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-15\">MSX2<\/a> computer. Although the computer's monitor is not shown directly, the cassette presumably contains Big Boss' plans for his \"Outer Heaven Uprising\" as depicted during the events of the original <a href=\"\/metal-gear\/3030-6712\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6712\">Metal Gear<\/a>. A post-credits timeline confirms that Venom was killed by <a href=\"\/solid-snake\/3005-75\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-75\">Solid Snake<\/a> while acting as Big Boss' phantom in Outer Heaven, while the true Big Boss was the one fought in <a href=\"\/zanzibar-land\/3035-240\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-240\">Zanzibar Land<\/a> at the end of <a href=\"\/metal-gear-2-solid-snake\/3030-723\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-723\">Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake<\/a>.<\/p><h3>Episode 51<\/h3><p>Though it was not in the final game, footage released showed Venom Snake tracking down Eli and the Sahelanthropus to a remote island where he released an English strain of the vocal chord parasites. However, XOF troops also discovered the same location and went in to acquire them for Cipher. When XOF's initial attack fails, Eli decides to declare war on the whole world, as Big Boss and the Diamond Dogs are once again forced to destroy the Sahelanthropus.<\/p><p>After the fight, a soldier finds that Eli has the new strain of the parasite in his own throat. The Diamond Dogs prepare to napalm the island and destroy the parasites for good, but Big Boss offers Eli a pistol with one bullet to use if he wants. As he leaves and Eli considers pulling the trigger, the Floating Boy reappears, psychically ripping the parasites from Eli's throat and helping him escape from the island before the napalm hits him.<\/p><p>It is implied that Eli somehow made it to New York, swearing vengeance upon Big Boss and his own brother.<\/p><h2>Multiplayer<\/h2><p>Two variations of online multiplayer are included with the game: Metal Gear Online (MGO) and Forward Operating Base (FOB). Metal Gear Online (currently still in development by <a href=\"\/kojima-productions-los-angeles\/3010-10605\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-10605\">Kojima Productions Los Angeles<\/a>) is the traditional multiplayer component of the game; Forward Operating Base, a separate multiplayer mode, allows players to create standalone bases called FOBs and defend them against invasions from other players.<\/p><h3>Metal Gear Online (MGO)<\/h3><p>The Phantom Pain contains a separate multiplayer mode that is being developed outside of the main Japan studio at Kojima Productions L.A. It has no effect on the single player. This gameplay mode is called Metal Gear Online, the third of its kind following its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/metal-gear-online\/3030-21414\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21414\">PS3 game<\/a> released back in 2008 on Metal Gear Solid 4. No information on game modes is available, and it has not been confirmed if the game mode will be available alongside the single player core game.<\/p><p>Players will have the same movements and animations as Snake, but will be able to customize their appearance in a variety of ways. It is not clear if the Ocelot or Snake character skins will have any special features or abilities. The Marking ability makes a return as well, and functions the same way requiring a couple of seconds before an enemy player is marked and visible to the entire team. Players can use items such as sensor grenades, claymore mines, a stuffed animal for distraction and it is also possible to use vehicles such as the bipedal walking gun platform that provides full cover from the front but is naked from the back, it could also kick riot shield wearing players but was susceptible to explosive attacks, the cardboard box remains an option for stealthy players. MGO has fulton cannons that will remove players from the battlefield, but just like the fulton in single player it can be shot down before taking effect.<\/p><h3>Forward Operating Base (FOB)<\/h3><p>Players will have an option to take a version of Mother Base online, where it will be called an FOB. FOBs can generate resources that can be used in the single-player Mother Base, which cannot be invaded at all. Both players will be Snake in this mode, with one attacking an FOB and one organizing the defense.<\/p><p>When the FOB is put online, the defender can be invaded at any time they are active, even during a single-player mission. If the player is not available but the FOB is still online, friends can be recruited to defend the FOB for them. The player has the option to ignore calls for help, but risks the attacker making off with their resources and personnel unabated.<\/p><p>Anyone can take their FOB offline as well, allowing them to organize base defenses and continue their single-player campaign without worrying about an invasion. However, doing so will severely hamper the player's ability to accrue resources.<\/p><h4>Offense<\/h4><p>The attacker can Fulton enemy soldiers and resources to their own base like in the main game, but has a time limit in which they must reach the enemy \"Platform Core\" and escape before the defenders block off the sea lanes and they get \"captured.\" The attacker only has one life, and fails the invasion if they get captured or killed. Also, if the attacker fails, the defender can learn the location of the attacker's own FOB and counter-attack it later. If the attacker succeeds without being spotted once, then the defender will not be able to counter-attack their FOB.<\/p><h4>Defense<\/h4><p>Defenders can lay out base defenses and guard patrols prior to an invasion. This includes everything from placing fellow soldiers on platform to activating armed drones to patrol around the FOB. When the attacker first appears on-site, the defender will only have a rough estimation of their location, but if the attacking Snake is spotted by cameras or patrols, the defender will be able to pinpoint their exact location. If the defending Snake is killed or captured, the defender has the option of respawning in the body of an allied soldier if there are any available. If the defender cannot successfully eliminate or capture the attacking Snake before he escapes, then the attacker will successfully capture any resources that were Fulton-ed out during the invasion.<\/p><h2>Locations<\/h2><h3>Cyprus<\/h3><p>Big Boss wakes from a nine-year coma in a British military hospital, but doesn't have long to get acquainted with the territory when unidentified military forces and a strange individual nicknamed \"The Man on Fire\" storm the building and try to kill him.<\/p><h3>Mother Base (Seychelles)<\/h3><p>Similar to the MSF base from Peace Walker, the newly-formed Diamond Dogs are able to launch missions all across the globe from this sea-based hub as Big Boss's private army. The base's defences and personnel can be customized as the player sees fit.<\/p><h3>Afghanistan<\/h3><p>Ocelot has tracked down Kaz to a remote camp in the mountains of <a href=\"\/afghanistan\/3035-1017\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1017\">Afghanistan<\/a>. Snake must race to rescue his captured comrade, but it will not be easy, as he must tread carefully between the <em>Mujahideen<\/em> of Afghanistan and the Russian forces occupying the country.<\/p><h3>Angola and Zaire (Central Africa)<\/h3><p>Cipher has spread its influence to mercenaries and rebel groups on both sides, trying to find the missing piece that will allow the latest Metal Gear to be completed.<\/p><h2>Development<\/h2><h3>Metal Gear Online<\/h3><p>At The Game Awards 2014, Metal Gear Online was debuted, shown was a 8v8 Team Sneak match, where an attacking team attempted to retrieve intel while the other defended.<\/p><h3>As \"The Phantom Pain\"<\/h3><p>The game was known for being vaguely introduced in a trailer as \"The Phantom Pain\" (by a fake Swedish developer known as \"Moby Dick Studio\", allegedly led by \"<a href=\"\/hideo-kojima\/3040-63395\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-63395\">Joakim Mogren<\/a>\") in order for Kojima to assess industry response for the FOX Engine. Despite hinted connections between the trailer and the Metal Gear franchise, the game remained mysterious until the 2013 Game Developers Conference, where it was officially revealed alongside Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes, which serves as the game's prologue.<\/p><p>After the trailer's release the internet started to speculate that Phantom Pain is a game created by Hideo Kojima for the Metal Gear franchise. Many hints were in the trailer including:<\/p><ul><li>The protagonist of Phantom Pain has the same mullet and facial hair as Big Boss in <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-ground-zeroes\/3030-39575\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-39575\">Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes<\/a>. He also has a bandage conspicuously covering his eyes, and the exact same scar that <a href=\"\/big-boss\/3005-475\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-475\">Big Boss<\/a> has in a Ground Zeroes poster.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>The doctor in the trailer's opening shares a vague resemblance to <a href=\"\/kio-marv\/3005-21140\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-21140\">Kio Marv<\/a> of <a href=\"\/metal-gear-2-solid-snake\/3030-723\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-723\">Metal Gear 2<\/a>, and also a resemblance to <a href=\"\/drago-pettrovich-madnar\/3005-18219\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-18219\">Dr. Madnar<\/a> from the same game. However, as both of those characters have only been seen in 8-bit graphics, admittedly they could look like anything in photo-realistic graphics.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>As the protagonist wakes up he sees white petals falling on him. A field of white flowers, and falling petals, were present in the death scene of the <a href=\"\/the-boss\/3005-478\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-478\">Boss<\/a> in <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater\/3030-18082\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18082\">Metal Gear Solid 3<\/a>.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>When the protagonist is taken from his bed he is initially unable to walk, and must crawl on the ground. This is very similar to the infamous Microwave Hallway scene from the climax of <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots\/3030-20669\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20669\">Metal Gear Solid 4<\/a>. The protagonist also runs very similar to Big Boss in Peace Walker.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>The guns used by the soldiers in Phantom Pain also appear in the Ground Zeroes trailer that are based off an actual gun made in the late seventies.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>While mostly cloaked in shadow, one burning soldier is shown to be wearing almost the exact same armor on his legs as <a href=\"\/colonel-volgin\/3005-3545\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3545\">Col. Volgin<\/a> from MGS3, which took place decades earlier. The body type looks similar as well but it could also be The Fury.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>A burning soldier who bears a likeness to MGS2-era- <a href=\"\/raiden\/3005-347\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-347\">Raiden<\/a> or <a href=\"\/ivan-raidenovitch-raikov\/3005-477\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-477\">Raikov<\/a> is seen falling over in room.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>The final shot of the trailer shows a figure hanging in the air in the same pose as Psycho Mantis from <a href=\"\/metal-gear-solid\/3030-16140\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16140\">Metal Gear Solid<\/a>.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>The only listed employee of Moby Dick Studios is Joakim Mogren. Joakim is an anagram of Kojima. Mogren is the football club of Budva, Montenegro, and Montenegro is the first level of <a href=\"\/metal-gear-rising-revengeance\/3030-26801\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-26801\">Metal Gear Rising<\/a>. Project Ogre is also the codename of The Phantom Pain. It should be noted Ogre is in Mogren.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>The negative space in the game's title at the end of the trailer spells out 'Metal Gear Solid V', though this is less useful as a clue as all of the Metal Gear Solid sequels to date have used standard numbers, not Roman numerals. Kojima even stated that he would never use Roman numerals in the main titles so this could be another game leading up to Metal Gear Solid 5 or Phantom Pain could possibly be Ground Zeroes.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>The title sequence for the reveal trailer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/photo.php?pid=1405230&amp;l=ae6163c78a&amp;id=141562502557584\" rel=\"nofollow\">was made by Prologue Films<\/a>. <a href=\"\/kyle-cooper\/3040-64921\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-64921\">Kyle Cooper<\/a> (of Prologue Films) <a href=\"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/A9kbvtICQAAleA9.jpg:large\" rel=\"nofollow\">was seen at Konami's VGA VIP Party<\/a> wearing a Phantom Pain\/Moby Dick Studio T-Shirt. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.giantbomb.com\/kyle-cooper\/3040-64921\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-64921\">Cooper<\/a> was also responsible for the title sequences of MGS2 and MGS3.<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>In the Phantom Pain trailer the bandaged guy says, \"On your feet soldier.\" while back in 2004 in a Metal Gear comic scan Gray Fox says the same exact quote.<\/li><\/ul><h2>PlayStation 4 Pro Support<\/h2><p>The PlayStation 4 Pro upgrade for the game provides minor improvements over the PlayStation 4 version. The primary improvement is the upgraded resolution of 2560x1440. Although Konami stated that the patch would bring performance upgrades to the game, with the exception of the some cut-scenes running seeing a slight improvement to their performance very little else is different with the PlayStation 4 Pro upgrade over the regular PlayStation 4 version. This is primarily due to the core PlayStation 4 version of the game being highly optimal version of the game which mostly locks at 60 frames per second, only dropping from the target frame-rate at edge cases.<\/p><h2>PC System Requirements<\/h2><h3>Minimum:<\/h3><ul><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 7x64, Windows 8x64 (64-bit OS Required)<\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Intel Core i5-4460
