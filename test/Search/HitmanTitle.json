It was the first Hitman game to release through an episodic method rather than traditional release. The first episode was released March 11th, 2016, with the sixth and last on October 31st, 2016.<\/p><p>A retail release with the complete first season was released on January 31st, 2017.

However upon numerous layoffs for veteran Hitman developers<a href=\"\/io-interactive\/3010-3562\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3562\"> IO Interactive<\/a>, they were once more given control of the next Hitman game, although all of their other projects were also cancelled in the process. Square Enix Montreal was involved with the Hitman franchise up until the sale of IO Interactive by Square Enix, but only for developing smaller tablet-based entries within the series such as <a href=\"\/hitman-go\/3030-46020\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-46020\">Hitman Go<\/a>.<\/p><p>IO Interactive updated their website on Jan 16, 2014, detailing the direction they intend to take with the next Hitman game.

However to reassure fans they released a concept image depicting Agent 47 in Central Europe showing one of the locations in the full game. They further stated the player will be able to explore the entire building shown in the image, and that its size will be larger than any level from Absolution.<\/p><p>Come E3, 2015, Hitman was given an official trailer during Sony's conference, now rebranded as simply 'Hitman'.<\/p><p> <\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><h3>Elusive Targets<\/h3><p>A new feature which sees new targets added to maps with only a certain time to complete them. The elusives targets can only be attempted once and the mission can't be retried if the player dies or fail any requirements for the target.<\/p><h3>Escalation Contracts<\/h3><p>Escalation Contracts are five-part contracts that progress in difficulty and are designed to test the player's mastery of different parts of the level. A new objective, target, or rule is added on with each subsequent level. For example, level 2 of an Escalation Target may require the player to assassinate the target detailed in level 1 but with the additional requirement that they avoid being spotted by security cameras. New Escalation Contracts are frequently added to each episode.<\/p><h3>Contracts Mode<\/h3><p>Players may <a href=\"\/user-generated-content\/3015-129\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-129\">create their own contracts<\/a> in any of the game's levels with up to five targets. Featured and most recently published contracts can be browsed and played.<\/p><p> <\/p><h2>Plot<\/h2><p>Each episode of Hitman contains a story chapter linked to at least one contract within each map. Backstory is given for each one, and upon completion a cutscene details the progression of the story's overarching narrative.<\/p><h3>20 Years Earlier<\/h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The prologue begins in the year 1999. Agent 47 steps off a helicopter in the mountains which leads into a secret International Contract Agency recruitment base. <a href=\"\/diana-burnwood\/3005-1841\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1841\">Diana Burnwood<\/a> greets him and speaks about the agency. 47 is lead to his quarters and is told his training will begin the next day.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">47 starts his training with a simulated test, he completes the test with great effectiveness prompting Burnwood to give him more time with free-form training.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">47\u2019s final test is a recreation of the agency director Erich Soders own legendary mission, where he had to kill Jasper Knight at a Cuban military base during the cold war. Soders believed 47 was a threat to all the agency stood for and because of this made the final harder than it once was. 47 overcame Soders challenge with the help of Burnwood and was accepted in the agency under the title of \u201cAgent\u201d.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">The prologue finishes with a conversation between Burnwood and 47. Burnwood tells 47 to lay low until The Agency contacts him. 47 leaves the mountains.<\/p><h3>The Showstopper<\/h3><p dir=\"ltr\">The game starts after the events of Hitman: Absolution, it is the year 2019 and Agent 47 has been given contract for <a href=\"\/viktor-novikov\/3005-34191\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-34191\">Viktor Novikov<\/a> and his acquaintance <a href=\"\/dalia-margolis\/3005-34190\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-34190\">Dalia Margolis<\/a>. IAGO, an intelligence agency has smuggled top secret information about MI6 agents in the middle east. Novikov and Margolis are part of a smuggling operation and MI6 contracts the ICA to kill them both and retrieve the information.<\/p><p dir=\"ltr\">A day earlier Novikov and an unnamed man referred to as the \"Shadow Client\" hold a meeting. The Shadow Client takes a notebook from Novikov and claims it\u2019s \u201cThe Secrets of the Global Elite.\u201d<\/p><h3>World of Tomorrow<\/h3><p>After Paris, Agent 47 travels to Sapienza, Italy where the ICA has been contracted to eliminate a DNA-specific virus capable of infecting anyone and leaving no evidence of ever being infected. Also 47 has been tasked with the job of assassinating the creator of the the virus <a href=\"\/dr-silvio-caruso\/3005-34189\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-34189\">Dr. Silvio Caruso<\/a> and his company appointed assistant <a href=\"\/dr-francesca-de-santis\/3005-34188\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-34188\">Dr. Francesca De Santis<\/a>.<\/p><p>A week later an unknown agent who was investigating the virus is ambushed in his car. The Shadow Client reveals that he has been following the agent since Italy after using agencies IAGO and the ICA to arrange for the destruction of the virus. He threatens the agent into giving him \"the key\", whilst the agent replies with a threat of the organization from \"Providence.\" The ambusher mentions \"Cobb\" had made a similar warning, takes the key, and then shoots the agent.<\/p><h3>A Gilded Cage<\/h3><p>After the events in Sapienza, 47 is dispatched to Marrakesh, Morocco to assassinate fugitive and alleged fraudster <a href=\"\/claus-hugo-strandberg\/3005-34187\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-34187\">Claus Hugo Strandberg<\/a> as well as <a href=\"\/reza-zaydan\/3005-34186\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-34186\">General Reza Zaydan<\/a>, leader of the military group who freed Strandberg and is currently staging a coup. Hamilton-Lowe, a defense contractor with lucrative deals under the current Moroccan government, wants them both eliminated before the coup can be launched. <\/p><p>At the same time, the Shadow Client continues his work to grab keys from various individuals, opening a vault as two agents from Providence come too late to stop his theft.<\/p><h3>Club 27<\/h3><p>47 is sent to a luxury hotel on the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok, Thailand to take out rock star prima-donna <a href=\"\/jordan-cross\/3005-34181\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-34181\">Jordan Cross<\/a> and his attorney <a href=\"\/ken-morgan\/3005-34180\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-34180\">Ken Morgan<\/a> after they were supposedly responsible for squashing any legal consequences for a drunk-driving incident that resulted in the death of his girlfriend, Hannah Highmoore. The family of Hanna asks the ICA to eliminate them both.<\/p><p>One week later, news emerges that Jordan's reclusive father was kidnapped from Jordan's funeral and later murdered. Diana quietly meets with 47 and tells him that she suspects Jordan's death was part of a ruse to lure his father out from hiding. Furthermore, all of 47's recent contracts were legitimate, but Diana suspects that they are being manipulated by some Shadow Client as part of a larger scheme they are not completely sure of.<\/p><h3>Freedom Fighters<\/h3><p>In the most sweeping mission yet, 47 is dispatched to an undisclosed militia camp in Colorado, United States to assassinate the militia leader and eco-terrorist <a href=\"\/sean-rose\/3005-34185\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-34185\">Sean Rose<\/a>, Interpol defector <a href=\"\/penelope-graves\/3005-34183\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-34183\">Penelope Graves<\/a>, former Mossad operative and interrogation specialist <a href=\"\/ezra-berg\/3005-34184\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-34184\">Ezra Berg<\/a>, and former assassin and combat instructor <a href=\"\/maya-parvati\/3005-34182\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-34182\">Maya Parvati<\/a>.<\/p><p>After 47 eliminates all 4 targets, he investigates the militia's command center in the tornado shelter and uncovers the shadow client has been following the missions of 47 for decades. It is believed that only someone with knowledge of 47's identity and the ICA could have done such a thing. 47 examines the board and sees the pictures of previous assassination targets from the game and discovers they're linked to the shadow organization Providence (seen repeatedly throughout the game) whose covert exploits influence world events. To further concerns of the integrity of the ICA, 47 finds a picture of ICA top brass <a href=\"\/erich-soders\/3005-34179\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-34179\">Erich Soders<\/a>. Diana and 47 assume that Soders was the mole who infiltrated the ICA and place him as a prime target for assassination.<\/p><h3>Situs Inversus<\/h3><p>In his final mission, and the only one that isn't a private contract, 47 makes his way to a snowy mountaintop medical facility named GAMA in Hokkaido, Japan to assassinate ICA defector <a href=\"\/erich-soders\/3005-34179\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-34179\">Erich Soders<\/a> and former yakuza lawyer and current Providence liaison <a href=\"\/yuki-yamazaki\/3005-34178\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-34178\">Yuki Yamazaki<\/a>.<\/p><p>Diana and 47 confirm that Soders has defected from ICA and is awaiting a rare heart transplant at the facility. 47 is sent in to assassinate Soders before he can give up the identities of ICA operatives and send a message to Providence not to interfere in ICA affairs by killing Yamazaki as well.<\/p><p>Having succeeded in the assassinations and gotten the attention of Providence, Diana is seated on a train where she is approached by an unknown Providence member from New York. The man tells Diana that they are aware that the infamous shadow client has used the ICA to attack and kill powerful members of Providence and that Providence would like to partner with the ICA to go after the shadow client. Diana is reluctant to accept the offer but the man offers additional information into 47's background, presenting a photograph of a young boy who looks suspiciously like 47.<\/p><p> <\/p><h2>Episodes<\/h2><p>Seven separate episodes were announced that would comprise a season. These were released over the course of 2016.<\/p><h3>Episode 1 - Intro Pack (Paris)<\/h3><p>This was the first release and was launched on March 11th, 2016.

Elusive Target contracts add a unique character to one of the game's episodes with their own backstory and briefing cutscene. Changes are often made to the level, such as additional security around the target.<\/p><p>The Elusive Target must be killed within a specified amount of real-world time, often between 53-72 hours. The player gets one attempt at taking out an Elusive Target, though they may restart and replan the contract as long as they haven't died. If the player does die, they may not replay the contract. Additionally, if the target is successfully killed the contract may not be replayed.

This game kicks off a while after the final showdown in <a href=\"\/hitman-codename-47\/3030-6709\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6709\">Hitman: Codename 47<\/a>, and Agent 47 has quit the <a href=\"\/assassin\/3015-1321\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1321\">assassin<\/a> trade to work as a gardener in a Sicilian church. However, it doesn't take long until troublemakers stir things up and kidnap Agent 47's priest and mentor, <a href=\"\/father-vittorio\/3005-2722\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2722\">Father Vittorio<\/a>, which forces Agent 47 to return to his past.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Gameplay-wise, there are many refinements in this sequel to the original game. The first obvious change is the control scheme, which has been fine-tuned for the third-person shooter perspective.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\"><a href=\"\/io-interactive\/3010-3562\/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3562\"> IO Interactive <\/a>also added an optional first-person perspective and a visual meter in order to give the player a basic outlook on the enemies' suspicion level, a feature that was further enhanced in later releases of the Hitman franchise.<\/p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Another major addition in Hitman 2: Silent Assassin is the new rating system. In the first game, there weren't any real incentives to get players to take a stealthy approach during the missions, which basically went against the design philosophy. In Silent Assassin, players are rated after each mission according to how they've performed - the lesser kills and detections, the higher the rating. The challenge comes in approaching the main target without having any hoodlums seeing Agent 47 come in or out. Players who mastered this were given the honorable title \"Silent Assassin\", which locked up hidden weapons and tools. Players who just go on a mad gun-crazed frenzy are often branded as \"Mass Murderer\".<\/p><h2>Levels<\/h2><h3>Sicily<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Agent 47's mentor and friend, Father Vittorio, has been kidnapped by the Sicilian Mafia, and they demand 500,000 in ransom. Unfortunately, Agent 47 is all out of cash, so he'll have to take some other approach to free the Father.<\/p><h3>St. Petersburg<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In return for information as to Father Vittorio's whereabouts, 47 must complete a small assignment for his former employers. This small assignment quickly evolves into four assassinations and a rather hairy run-in with a Spetznaz agent.<\/p><h3>Japan<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Agent 47 goes to Japan to eliminate an arms dealer and to recover a missile guidance system from his castle.<\/p><h3>Malaysia<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">This time, the Agency calls in 47 to eliminate a powerful hacker who has his hands on an important piece of missile defense software.<\/p><h3>Nuristan<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Agent 47 goes to the Middle East to retrieve some important piece of cargo for his Agency.<\/p><h3>India<\/h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A mysterious Indian cult has gotten their hands on some nukes.<\/p><h2>Weapons<\/h2><h4>Melee<\/h4><ul><li>Anaesthetic<\/li><li>Fiber Wire<\/li><li>Kitchen Knife<\/li><li>Combat Knife<\/li><li>Scalpel<\/li><li>Golf Club<\/li><li>Katana Sword<\/li><li>Fire Axe<\/li><\/ul><h4>Pistols<\/h4><ul><li>Silverballer .45<\/li><li>Silverballer .45 Suppressed<\/li><li>9mm Pistol<\/li><li>9mm Pistol Suppressed<\/li><li>Deagle<\/li><li>Stub-Nosed Revolver<\/li><li>.54 Pistol<\/li><li>.22 Suppressed<\/li><\/ul><h4>Sub-Machine Guns<\/h4><ul><li>Uzi<\/li><li>SMG<\/li><li>SMG-SD6<\/li><\/ul><h4>Assault Rifles<\/h4><ul><li>AK-74<\/li><li>M4<\/li><\/ul><h4>Shotguns<\/h4><ul><li>Double-Barreled Shotgun<\/li><li>Sawn-Off Shotgun<\/li><li>SP12 Shotgun<\/li><\/ul><h4>Sniper Rifles<\/h4><ul><li>Crossbow<\/li><li>R93 Sniper<\/li><li>Dragunov SVD Sniper<\/li><li>MI95 Sniper<\/li><li>W2000 Sniper<\/li><li>W2000 Custom Sniper Rifle<\/li><\/ul><h4>Heavy Weapons<\/h4><ul><li>M60 LMG<\/li><\/ul><h2>HD Re-release<\/h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Hitman 2: Silent Assassin was re-released with high definition graphics as part of the <a href=\"\/hitman-hd-trilogy\/3030-40084\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-40084\">Hitman: HD Trilogy<\/a> on January 29, 2013.

Fortunately, the majority of the game's levels are relatively small to encourage experimentation.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/129563\/2797774-hitman_go_shot_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2797774\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"2048\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 2048px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/129563\/2797774-hitman_go_shot_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2797774\"><img alt=\"Agent 47 must distract a blue-colored guard to complete this level\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/129563\/2797774-hitman_go_shot_1.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/129563\/2797774-hitman_go_shot_1.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/12\/129563\/2797774-hitman_go_shot_1.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/129563\/2797774-hitman_go_shot_1.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/129563\/2797774-hitman_go_shot_1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>Agent 47 must distract a blue-colored guard to complete this level<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Players must reach each level's goal point, a fixed node usually positioned at the opposite end of the playing grid, in order to progress to the next level. All movement of playing pieces is <a href=\"\/turn-based\/3015-192\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-192\">turn-based<\/a> and restricted to the grid's paths and nodes. During their turn, the player's piece may move once between two connected nodes and, if applicable, utilize certain objects.<\/p><p>Nearly all of the game's levels also contain a number of enemy pieces which must be <a href=\"\/stealth\/3015-24\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-24\">evaded<\/a> or <a href=\"\/murder\/3015-1654\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1654\">removed from play<\/a> to reach the goal. Enemies can be eliminated by moving onto an enemy's currently occupied node in a fashion similar to <a href=\"\/chess\/3015-2483\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2483\">chess<\/a>. However, if an enemy piece moves onto the player's occupied node during its turn, the game is over.

After completing a handful of the game's initial levels, the player can begin fulfilling <a href=\"\/optional-objective\/3015-3461\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3461\">optional secondary objectives<\/a> in order to earn up to three stamps per level. Such secondary objectives include completing a level without killing any guards, finishing the level under a specified number of moves and picking up a brief case located within the level.<\/p><p>As the player progresses, several new mechanics are introduced that add further gameplay wrinkles; potted plants can be used as <a href=\"\/hiding\/3015-8548\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-8548\">hiding<\/a> spots, objects can be thrown to distract and change the movement patterns of enemies, and new types of enemies appear with their own unique

Absolution features a more personal story about <a href=\"\/agent-47\/3005-889\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-889\">Agent 47<\/a>, who has been betrayed and must uncover a conspiracy. 47's ultimate mission is to assassinate <a href=\"\/diana-burnwood\/3005-1841\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1841\">Diana Burnwood<\/a>, his former employer and friend who provided him his missions in the previous games.<\/p><p>The game centers around Agent 47 assassinating targets. As in previous games, 47 can use the environment to his advantage. He can choke an enemy with a power cable, for example, or knock them out with a statuette. Also, 47 can disguise himself and the game world reacts to what disguise you are wearing. For instance, by wearing a police uniform and passing through a street full of drug addicts, 47 will cause all of the <a href=\"\/non-player-character\/3015-967\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-967\">NPC<\/a>s to react by fleeing in fear; many other reactions may occur, depending on the situation. However, once you enter the <a href=\"\/police-station\/3035-1558\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1558\">police station<\/a>, a single wrong move or a prolonged exposure to the surrounding police NPCs will blow your disguise. This can either happen gradually, or suddenly, depending on the situation and surrounding NPCs.<\/p><p>All these actions build up the \"Instinct\" meter. This gives 47 an advantage; as his Instinct tells him where enemies are, the best routes to take, where enemies routinely patrol, and even highlights important objects in the world.<\/p><p>Absolution was made from the ground up using IO Interactive's new <a href=\"\/glacier-engine-2\/3015-7225\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7225\">Glacier 2.0 engine<\/a>.<\/p><p>Hitman: Absolution marks the first game in the series to not feature <a href=\"\/jesper-kyd\/3040-30329\/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-30329\">Jesper Kyd<\/a> as the game's composer. IO Interactive producer Hakan Abrak said in an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vg247.com\/2011\/10\/10\/sing-for-absolution-io-answers-your-qs-on-hitman-absolution\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">interview<\/a> that Kyd was unable to work on Absolution due to his involvement with Assassin's Creed games and that the original soundtrack will be composed by Peter Peter and Peter Kyed.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>Missions start with pre-determined weapons; the player cannot choose what weapon to start a mission with.<\/p><p>47 uses both non-lethal and lethal take-downs to accomplish his objectives. The player can approach an enemy from behind and choose to subdue them instead of snapping their neck. Using guns and knives will result in killing the enemy, while some thrown weapons will just annoy or distract a target. There are also non-lethal and lethal take-downs involving special tools or opportunities in the environment. When a warning triangle (yellow with an exclamation mark) is displayed with the button to perform an action, it is an indicator that your action is going to be taken as suspicious or hostile by any witnesses. Certain areas will be restricted to people dressed a certain way, and others will just be off-limits entirely. When the player has entered a restricted area you will see a \"Trespassing\" message on the HUD with the warning triangle.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/57793\/1805928-5529screen_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1805928\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 1920px\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/57793\/1805928-5529screen_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1805928\"><img alt=\"Agent 47\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/57793\/1805928-5529screen_01.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/5\/57793\/1805928-5529screen_01.jpg 1920w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/5\/57793\/1805928-5529screen_01.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/5\/57793\/1805928-5529screen_01.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/5\/57793\/1805928-5529screen_01.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><figcaption>Agent 47<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The disguises system is back from the previous games, but has one major modification. Agent 47 can take the clothes from most killed or incapacitated enemies and leave his current clothes there. While in a disguise, anyone in similar clothing will become suspicious of 47 if he is in their line-of-sight. Crowds can be used to break a line-of-sight. The closer 47 gets, the easier and sooner they will spot him, and once spotted, they will attempt to apprehend him. At that point, the player can either fight or flee, but if the player flees they will become openly hostile until he changes into another disguise. If the player decides to fight them they must kill everyone that was involved in spotting them in order to no longer be suspicious.<\/p><p>Agent 47 can use the new Instinct system to get the advantage over his enemies. Instinct will naturally regenerate on the easier difficulties and will be replenished by certain player actions. Instinct can be used to highlight enemies, their patrol routes, and objects of interest throughout the world. While using instinct, people that have the same disguise are highlighted yellow, enemies and targets are highlighted red, and points\/objects of interested are marked by three concentric circles. Patrol routes of NPCs are marked by a line of small flames on the ground, also any crowd that you are currently using to break line-of-sight will be highlighted in blue. It can also be used to delay discovery by NPCs that are in the same group of your current disguise, this drains instinct very quickly.<\/p><p>Player performance on mission sections is represented by a score. Various actions throughout the section will increase or decrease the score. For example, the player will get a heavy score penalty for killing a non-target civilian. Pacifying a non-target NPC will also decrease the player's score, but they can earn it back if the body is hidden. Going completely undetected and only killing the target will give the player a \"Silent Assassin Bonus\" and the highest possible score. The average score for the player's respective country and the world is displayed prior to starting an area.<\/p><h3>Difficulty Modes<\/h3><p>Hitman Absolution features five difficulty modes of varying difficulties and features.<\/p><table><thead><tr><th>Enhanced: Easy<\/th><th>Enhanced: Medium<\/th><th>Professional: Hard<\/th><th>Professional: Expert<\/th><th>Professional: Purist<\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td>Supreme training and a physique enhance beyond ordinary human capacity mean your enemies are no match for you.

Hitman sneaks to the 8th floor and enters room 899 via air duct. While crawling through the air duct 47 overhears a conversation between Blake and Layla Stockton his secretary and personal assistant. They speak about Dexter's plan of kidnapping Victoria and ransoming her back to the Agency. After this point 47 sneaks into the room and begins strangling Sanchez, Blake's personal bodyguard who underwent experimentation in Blake's labs that resulted in his gigantism.

House keeping arrives at this point and Blake invites her, only to slit her throat. He frames 47 for the murder and then sets fire to the apartment and the hotel. Once 47 regains consciousnesses he is then forced to flee the police. After he evades them 47 receives another phone call from Birdie, wherein 47 is told about Dom Osmond, a close friend and informant to Dexter Blake.

Once 47 reaches Birdie's buss he fails to find him and asks a homeless man if he saw Birdie. The homeless man says he saw him leaving with a cowboy and says that he thinks they went downtown. Hitman boards Birdie's buss and heads for the orphanage, at this point it is revealed that Birdie choose to betray 47 to Wade and reveals Victoria's location to save his own life. 47 arrives at the orphanage to find that Victoria is sick and that the doctors can't find out what's wrong. He then takes the necklace Victoria wears and attaches it to her neck after which she regains her strength, then gunshots are heard as Wade's goons begin to kill everyone in the orphanage. 47 plans to take Victoria to the basement, which is the safest area in the orphanage. Before he can do so however, he needs to find the fuses to activate the elevator. As he does Victoria is found by Wade and he takes her, 47 then rushes to rescue her. In the meantime Wade takes Victoria to the central heating part of the orphanage, there he begins to belittle Lenny - Dexter's son, who had come with Wade at Dexter's request. Lenny becomes enraged and puts on a show by pointing a gun at a nun's head, unfortunately he accidentally fires and kills the nun. By this time 47 had reached central heating and eventually makes his way towards Wade and kills him. As he gets ready to land the fatal shot Lenny takes Victoria hostage and moves towards the exit while holding a grenade in one hand and Victoria in the other. 47 watches powerless as they leave, and then turns to Wade to find out where he comes from in hopes of finding Lenny and Blake Dexter. He finds a matchbox from the \"Great Balls of Fire\" bar in Hope, South Dakota. As Wade dies he utters his last words \"I've got wood man, why do I have wood?\" 47 then leaves the orphanage, and takes Wade's car to Hope. Once there he stops at the Great Balls of Fire and asks the bartender for Lenny's location, he responds that Lenny can be found at the barbershop every day at 12 o'clock sharp.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/122249\/2386508-hma_2012_12_07_16_25_03_88.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2386508\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.8\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/122249\/2386508-hma_2012_12_07_16_25_03_88.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2386508\"><img alt=\"Hope, South Dakota\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/122249\/2386508-hma_2012_12_07_16_25_03_88.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/122249\/2386508-hma_2012_12_07_16_25_03_88.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/12\/122249\/2386508-hma_2012_12_07_16_25_03_88.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/122249\/2386508-hma_2012_12_07_16_25_03_88.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/122249\/2386508-hma_2012_12_07_16_25_03_88.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Hope, South Dakota\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/122249\/2386508-hma_2012_12_07_16_25_03_88.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/122249\/2386508-hma_2012_12_07_16_25_03_88.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/12\/122249\/2386508-hma_2012_12_07_16_25_03_88.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/122249\/2386508-hma_2012_12_07_16_25_03_88.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/122249\/2386508-hma_2012_12_07_16_25_03_88.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Hope, South Dakota<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Hitman makes his way to the barbershop, only to find that Lenny arrived with his entourage, the \"Hope Cougars\".

The Cougars plan on betraying Lenny and Blake by taking Victoria and selling her to a rival arms company themselves. Hitman decides that he has to kill them because they know too much. After he's done with the Cougars 47 kidnaps Lenny and takes him to a desert, where he forces Lenny to dig his own grave. Lenny begs and pleads for his life, eventually pissing himself, then he reveals Victoria's location - Dexter Industries. 47 then tells him to stop digging and start walking. The player then has the choice of killing Lenny with a wide variety of weapons and tools, or sparing him by driving away.<\/p><p>47's next stop is Dexter Industries.

But before 47 goes there he stops at the Waikiki Motel, a Hawaiian themed motel to recuperate from his fight with Sanchez, there 47 is attacked by Travis's pet hit squad \"The Saints\".<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/122249\/2386444-47_leaves_hope.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2386444\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 1280px\" data-ratio=\"0.72109375\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:72.1%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/122249\/2386444-47_leaves_hope.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2386444\"><img alt=\"47 leaving Hope\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/122249\/2386444-47_leaves_hope.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/122249\/2386444-47_leaves_hope.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/12\/122249\/2386444-47_leaves_hope.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/122249\/2386444-47_leaves_hope.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/122249\/2386444-47_leaves_hope.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"47 leaving Hope\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/122249\/2386444-47_leaves_hope.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/12\/122249\/2386444-47_leaves_hope.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/12\/122249\/2386444-47_leaves_hope.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/12\/122249\/2386444-47_leaves_hope.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/12\/122249\/2386444-47_leaves_hope.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>47 leaving Hope<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>After he deals with them 47 makes his way to the Hope courthouse in hopes of gaining access to the prison and finding Victoria.

Skurky assures Blake that he'll get it out of 47. Before Skurky could do so 47 manages to escape the prison, only to find that Travis has taken over the town with the help of a large amount of ICA personnel.

Travis hoped to double cross Blake, Blake seeing this shoots the person with the bag on her head, presumably Victoria. Travis is shocked and outraged and Blake takes off the bag to show that it was someone other than Victoria all along. This forces Travis to give Blake the 10 million dollars in hopes of Blake turning Victoria over. As Blake makes his way to his penthouse apartment with the money he is warned that 47 is on his way. Blake panics and his assistant Layla reassures him that she can handle the assassin, 47 proves her wrong and moves towards Blake's position. Blake is by this point desperate, and orders his security personnel to lay explosives on the roof while he waits for his helicopter.

The reporter, Rick Henderson, arranged to interview Cayne in regards to a recent attack on the <a href=\"\/the-white-house\/3035-86\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-86\">White House<\/a>. It quickly becomes clear that Cayne's real intent is to discuss his views on human cloning and his obsession with capturing the genetically engineered super assassin. Cayne lies about many of the details that he gives Rick Henderson such as stating that 47 stole cloning data from <a href=\"\/dr-otto-wolfgang-ort-meyer\/3005-3879\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3879\">Ort-Meyer<\/a> to sell to the highest bidder.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3419\/932945-hbm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-932945\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.8\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3419\/932945-hbm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-932945\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3419\/932945-hbm.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3419\/932945-hbm.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/3419\/932945-hbm.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3419\/932945-hbm.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3419\/932945-hbm.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><\/figure><p>The story of 47 is gradually revealed as the player completes the various contracts they receive. The main story really begins when Diana informs 47 that they are the only two left in the agency. It is implied that the others have been systematically wiped out by Mark Purayah II and <a href=\"\/mark-parchezzi-iii\/3005-3753\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3753\">Mark Parchezzi III<\/a> - two of The Franchise's best assassins.<\/p><p>Diana finally decides to close down the agency but not before she gives 47 one final contract. This is the mission \"A Dance with the Devil\", where 47 must infiltrate a party at the CIA headquarters and take out the assassins who are trying to kill him. Once this is complete he and Diana split the funds and go their separate ways.<\/p><p>After what seems to be 47's final contract he is approached by an old CIA acquaintance named Smith (who 47 has previously rescued from a rehabilitation clinic in the mission \"Flatline\"). He requests that 47 take on a mission to kill the men who are trying to assassinate the President of the United States. These men are Vice President Daniel Morris and <a href=\"\/mark-parchezzi-iii\/3005-3753\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3753\">Mark Parchezzi III<\/a>, who are both working for Alpha Xerox. This is a political organization which owns \"The Franchise\" and wish to monopolize the cloning facility that created 47. They want the President taken out before the elections so that he is definitely not elected and so he cannot forward his pro-cloning policy. This would prevent Alpha Xerox from attaining the monopoly on cloning.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3419\/932950-hitmanbloodmoney2009_03_1618_22_27_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-932950\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1440\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1440px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3419\/932950-hitmanbloodmoney2009_03_1618_22_27_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-932950\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3419\/932950-hitmanbloodmoney2009_03_1618_22_27_.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3419\/932950-hitmanbloodmoney2009_03_1618_22_27_.jpg 1440w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/3419\/932950-hitmanbloodmoney2009_03_1618_22_27_.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3419\/932950-hitmanbloodmoney2009_03_1618_22_27_.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3419\/932950-hitmanbloodmoney2009_03_1618_22_27_.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/a><\/figure><p>During this mission 47 successfully kills Morris and also finally takes down Parchezzi in a shootout on the roof of the White House. After this mission a newspaper article is shown which states that the authorities believe Parchezzi to be Morris' assassin. As he is now being hunted by both enemy operatives and the police 47 retreats to his hideout. Here he is approached by Diana without warning which instantly arouses his suspicion as they rarely meet face to face. She proposes a plan which should secure both of them safety from \"The Franchise\". As 47 is considering the idea and reading the briefing he expresses his doubts about its success. However, before he can say any more Diana injects him with what seems to be a poison. 47's body is quickly surrounded by SWAT members, and Diana, announcing that bringing down 47 was \"surprisingly pleasant\" is inducted into \"The Franchise\" by Cayne, it's founder.<\/p><p>After this event the plot suddenly returns to present day, with Cayne and Rick Henderson, where 47's body is about to be cremated so that rival cloning companies cannot take a sample of his bone marrow and no more non-defective clones can ever be made. Diana approaches 47's body and places his signature <a href=\"\/amt-hardballer\/3055-483\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-483\">Silverballer<\/a> pistols on his chest during his funeral and kisses him after applying lipstick. It then becomes clear that the \"poison\" that Diana used on 47 was actually a fake death serum which is used earlier in the game and that her lipstick contained the antidote. This shows that this was Diana's true plan to save them both and she did not betray 47. The game can then end in one of two ways. As the player watches 47 lying on a pedestal before he is cremated a faint heartbeat can be heard. If the player does not react in any way then 47 will be lowered into the crematorium and will perish. However, if the player keeps spinning both of the analog sticks then 47 will come back to life and the player will have to control him as he takes out all of the witnesses to his revival. Many of the witnesses try to escape but it becomes apparent that Diana has locked the gates of the exit and no one survives except 47 (and Diana, who had left earlier).<\/p><p>The game ends with a cut-scene in which Diana states that she has made the Agency operational again using the funds of \"The Franchise\". She is on the phone with someone who she refers to as \"Your Majesty\". Diana then says to this mysterious person that the Agency has lost track of 47. The game finally ends with 47 in a brothel having a conversation with a traditionally dressed Chinese man on what can only be assumed is another job.<\/p><h2>Missions<\/h2><p>The missions during the game are listed below, along with a brief overview of how they are tasked, and the intel that can be purchased in the pre-mission briefing. Typically, the missions occur in order of difficulty though for the inexperienced or violent player, <i>A Vintage Year<\/i> can pose more problems than some other missions due to the small corridors of the house and the guards who are armed with shotguns and the SAF SMG.<\/p><h3>The Death of a Showman<\/h3><p>The Death of a Showman is the tutorial level for Hitman: Blood Money, and is intended to introduce the player to the mechanics of the game, such as poisoning food or water. The mission involves assassinating Joseph Clarence, better known as 'Mr. Swing King', after an accident at his amusement park caused the deaths of several children. One vengeful parent decides that Mr. Swing King should be punished severely. Enemies during the level are gang members, as the amusement park is being used by a 'Mr. Scoop' in order to produce drugs under a supposed agreement that will allow Clarence to restart his amusement park. The Death of a Showman is considered by players as a poor tutorial, as it encourages killing enemies who do not otherwise need to be killed to complete an objective. For example, one of the instructions is to kill two gang members in a room with a shotgun, before hiding the bodies. It would theoretically be possible to continue without having to kill them. The Death of a Showman has no intel, and does not need to be completed for Xbox 360 <a href=\"\/achievements\/3015-29\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-29\">achievements<\/a> related to completing the game on different difficulty settings. It is not possible to receive a rating on this level.<\/p><h3>A Vintage Year<\/h3><p>A Vintage Year is the first 'true' mission of the game, and places Agent 47 in <a href=\"\/chile\/3035-3002\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3002\">Chile<\/a>, during a wine convention held by one Fernando Delgado. His son, Manuel, is using the vineyard as a front for distributing cocaine. Only Fernando was requested for execution by a client, though it is viewed as safer to eliminate Manuel as well, in order to make it appear as a drug-related killing. The mission introduces a camera, used by a Chilean television crew who are present at the event. As usual, Agent 47 should be avoiding the cameras to complete the hits set out. To escape, players depart using a seaplane which has docked at the vineyard.<\/p><p>Due to the nature of this mission, it is one of the hardest missions to play aggressively. Guards are armed with the pump-action shotguns, while VIP Guards wield the SAF SMG. Unusually the VIP Guards are less well armed than the standard guards due to the relatively tight confines of the villa, where the shotgun can do the most damage. VIP Guards have access to the villa and drug lab though standard guards do not. A Vintage Year is the first mission where a player can earn the Silent Assassin rating, and also introduces intel that can be bought to make the mission easier to complete. The intel is copied directly from the game below.<\/p><h4>Intel<\/h4><ul><li>The guided tour of the wine cellar might prove useful, especially when looking for potential death traps.<\/li><li>We've heard that Manuel likes to entertain friends and enjoy the merchandise in the wine cellar.<\/li><li>The entrance to the secret lab is hidden somewhere in the wine cellar.<\/li><li>The insides are guarded by highly trained guards.<\/li><li>Cost is $3,500 each<\/li><\/ul><p><b>Cost for all Intel<\/b> = $14,000<\/p><p><b>Grand Total<\/b> = $14,000<\/p><h3>Curtains Down<\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62561\/1513641-bloodmoneyhitman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1513641\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.8\" data-width=\"1280\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62561\/1513641-bloodmoneyhitman.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1513641\"><img alt=\"Tenor Alvaro 'Alvade can be seen in position alongside the executioner\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/62561\/1513641-bloodmoneyhitman.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62561\/1513641-bloodmoneyhitman.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/6\/62561\/1513641-bloodmoneyhitman.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/6\/62561\/1513641-bloodmoneyhitman.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/62561\/1513641-bloodmoneyhitman.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Tenor Alvaro 'Alvade can be seen in position alongside the executioner\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/62561\/1513641-bloodmoneyhitman.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/6\/62561\/1513641-bloodmoneyhitman.jpg 1280w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/6\/62561\/1513641-bloodmoneyhitman.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/6\/62561\/1513641-bloodmoneyhitman.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/6\/62561\/1513641-bloodmoneyhitman.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>Tenor Alvaro 'Alvade can be seen in position alongside the executioner<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Curtains Down opens in the Paris Opera House. Agent 47 has been tasked to assassinate two men: Richard Delahunt, and Alvaro D'Alvade. Richard Delahunt is an American ambassador with a fascination for D'Alvade, who is performing as the tenor in <i>Tosca<\/i>, which is being performed. Agent 47's chance to strike comes when the tenor faces a firing squad, and strike he does. The two men supposedly run a child trafficking ring in Eastern Europe, and a client has requested their death. Agent 47 is dispatched to make this a reality.<\/p><p>It is during Curtains Down that we first see specialized bodyguards protecting Delahunt. It is possible to dress as the executioner and shoot Alvaro directly, though it is much easier to simply replace the prop Mauser pistol he uses with a real pistol that can be attained through talking with the secretary. It is also possible to take 47's talents onto the stage by dressing as one of the supporting actors, and taking a prop rifle. Then stand and watch Alvaro's death at the hands of his unwitting killer.<\/p><p>It is possible to complete this mission in less than a minute, though with a very low rating. If a player is on a low difficulty, they can shoot their way in to the box where Delahunt watches from, and then shoot Alvaro D'Alvade as he acts his role on the stage. This method ceases to work on higher difficulties, where Agent 47 will be killed before being able to line up a shot with Alvaro on the stage below, or before he can reach the exit again. It is entirely possible to finish the mission in this manner on both Easy and Normal difficulties though is not recommended for Expert or Professional levels for obvious reasons.<\/p><p>Completing Curtains Down with a Silent Assassin rating is difficult due to the vigilant guards and long time spent waiting in order to ensure all enemies are in position before making a move. The approach involves replacing the executioner's pistol with a real World War I-era handgun so that he will shoot D'Alvade dead.

To smuggle Smith out, Agent 47 will need an experimental serum that will give him the appearance of being dead, without actually killing him.

However, his wife possesses a piece of information that would still be of value regardless of Vinnie's position in the world: on it, or buried in it. It is a piece of microfilm, hidden in her necklace.

It is utterly vital that the politician, and his float, are protected during the celebrations.<\/p><p>As a bonus, a case of blood diamonds are changing hands during the festivities, and Agent 47 will be paid extra should he manage to bring them as well. The diamonds are carried by a red bird seen in the hotel at the beginning of the mission, and he will take them across to Mark II by the bookshop. It is possible to intercept him on the way there or walk out, killing Mark II and taking the diamonds as well. Entering the area without the diamonds as the red bird will cause the AI to begin demanding the diamonds on a constant loop, meaning the mission will be virtually impossible to finish.<\/p><h4>Intel<\/h4><ul><li>Walkie Talkies transmit everything - even background sound and music, which could reveal someone's location.<\/li><li>Clubs usually have a back entrance for the staff.<\/li><li>Bookstore walls are like paper - Agent 47 can overhear what's going on next door.<\/li><li>Clubs in this area are known for having hat-dress codes and music themes.<\/li><li>Some private apartments have a useful view.<\/li><li>Pianos can kill - especially when they are dropped from the sky.<\/li><li>A guy dressed as a yellow bird checked into a hotel room a couple of hours ago.<\/li><li>Cost is $3,500 each<\/li><li>Cost for all 7 = $24,500<\/li><li>Grand Total = $122,500<\/li><\/ul><h3>You Better Watch Out..<\/h3><p>Lorne de Havilland is a porn tycoon, who is holding a Christmas party at his reclusive mansion.

Vaana can be found in the Hell party, and Anthony in the Heaven party. Upon assassinating one of the two, other targets will become apparent. A female assassin called Eve, and a male assassin called Maynard John become targets as well. Eve likens herself to a spider, and Maynard John has a passion for the theatrical, referring to Agent 47 as 'less than human'. John challenges Agent 47 to a duel, in the Hell Party.

Requiem is considered as a canon mission, and among those eliminated is Rick Henderson. <a href=\"\/diana-burnwood\/3005-1841\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1841\">Diana Burnwood<\/a> is not present, as it appears she ensured 47 could accomplish this feat, using the serum that was seen during 'Flatline'.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>The gameplay in Blood Money follows the same path as the previous Hitman games in many regards. The basic concept remains the same: Agent 47 must take out his mark(s) any way he sees fit. The way Agent 47 goes about this is entirely up to the player and the game this time around gives Agent 47 even more options then the previous Hitman games to leave a personal touch.<\/p><p>One new game mechanic is the ability to use 'environmental' kills, i.e. rigging a bomb to a beam and then waiting for the right moment to remotely detonate it and take out the mark. Another new feature is the ability to customize weaponry and gadgets. This can consist of larger magazines, red dot and laser sights, better silencers, armor piercing rounds which can go through doors and Kevlar vests, and many more tweaks. Other new abilities 47 has is the ability to take hostages, throw weapons and bombs, and the much welcomed close combat attacks. Nothing feels better than head butting someone and then punching them in the face, or the ability to grab a threats weapon while elbowing them in the face in the process (however there's always the chance that they may pull the trigger, resulting in alerting nearby guards).<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3107\/194695-hitman_hostage.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-194695\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3107\/194695-hitman_hostage.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-194695\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3107\/194695-hitman_hostage.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3107\/194695-hitman_hostage.jpg 640w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3107\/194695-hitman_hostage.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3107\/194695-hitman_hostage.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3107\/194695-hitman_hostage.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/3107\/194695-hitman_hostage.jpg 640w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/3107\/194695-hitman_hostage.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/3107\/194695-hitman_hostage.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><p>Another new addition to gameplay is the concept of witnesses, which are any AI character(s) who witness Agent 47 do something violent during a mission and survive to talk about it. Witnesses can negatively impact the overall rating at the end of a mission, so in many cases Agent 47 must be even more careful in Blood Money then in previous Hitman games. However a witness is no longer a threat if they are dead\u2026<\/p><p>Which brings us to another new concept in Blood Money, the notoriety level. Notoriety is dictated by the number of witnesses that are alive at the end of any given mission. The notoriety will carry through to the next mission the player attempts, the higher their notoriety the more likely someone will be able to see through the disguise and identify Agent 47 as a fugitive. However, the player can always opt to decrease their notoriety at the end of each mission, for a price.<\/p><p>The newspaper is another new game feature which the player gets to see at the end of each mission, which describes the murder(s) they committed. The newspaper can also offer a deeper back story of the mark(s) Agent 47 just took out and the articles surrounding the main article are usually an entertaining read as well as hinting at what will happen in later missions.<\/p><h2>Weapons<\/h2><p>Blood Money contains an assortment of upgradeable weapons, which players may choose to bring along when on a contract. To upgrade a weapon, the player needs money, which is attained from successfully completing missions. Each weapon has 5 levels to upgrade, with each level increasingly more expensive.<\/p><table><tbody><tr><th>Level 1<\/th><th>Level 2<\/th><th>Level 3<\/th><th>Level 4<\/th><th>Level 5<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>$50,000<\/td><td>$75,000<\/td><td>$100,000<\/td><td>$150,000<\/td><td>$200,000<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><p>There are 5 unique upgradeable weapons. To fully upgrade all weapons it would cost $7,075,000. However, Agent 47 can steal enemy weapons and use those.

However, these two cons are balanced by massive firepower and extreme damage. A single shot to the chest of a victim normally guarantees a kill when using Magnum Ammo.<\/p><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><p>Long Slide<\/p><\/td><td><p>Longer slide for the Hardballer. This selection decreases recoil, and increases the accuracy of the shooter. When used with Low Velocity ammunition it is worth considering, at least until the second Silencer is unlocked, whereupon it is <i>normally<\/i> a better choice.<\/p><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><p><a href=\"\/dual-wielding\/3015-135\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-135\">Dual Wield<\/a><\/p><\/td><td><p>Double the firepower, double the fun. The second Hardballer gives Agent 47 more of everything. It is normally a good choice, though when carrying a briefcase or two-handed weapon, he will only draw the one, as opposed to the two weapons.<\/p><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><p><b>4<\/b><\/p><\/td><td><p><a href=\"\/red-dot-sight\/3055-1037\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1037\">Red Dot Sight<\/a><\/p><\/td><td>A Red Dot Sight is mounted on the slide of the gun, providing a more accurate sight than the Laser Sight which was made available earlier in the game. The RDS is viewed as a scope of sorts, and as such, it has some sway and Agent 47 will hold his breath. It is relatively accurate, but experienced shooters may find it a drawback if they can line up a <a href=\"\/headshot\/3015-85\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-85\">headshot<\/a> easily with previous attachments.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><p>Large Clip<\/p><\/td><td><p>Doubles the size of the magazines used in the weapon, from 9 rounds to 18. Trigger-happy players will <i>love<\/i> this, but it also serves a useful benefit if compromised.

The Type 2 Silencer is much quieter than the Type 1, and is a fairly useful piece of equipment in all scenarios. It beats the Type 1 Silencer in all ways, and if a silenced weapon is one of the player's preferences, then this will improve on the base weapon in many different ways.<\/p><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><p>Full Auto Fire<\/p><\/td><td><p>Full-Auto modifies the internals of the Silverballer to make it capable of firing fully automatic, as opposed to semi-automatic. Recoil builds more quickly with this customisation, and ammo is drained much faster, but it is potentially extremely useful in areas with a large number of guards present.<\/p><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><p><a href=\"\/scope\/3055-738\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-738\">Scope<\/a><\/p><\/td><td><p>A Scope, which will be mounted on the Rail Mount along the slide of the gun. It cannot be used with the Red Dot Sight, but provides more zoom and extreme precision. It does not give the same range as 47's Walther 2000 sniper rifle, but it can still be used for longer-range engagements.<\/p><\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><h3><a href=\"\/spas-12\/3055-1364\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1364\">SPAS-12<\/a><\/h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/749\/1337232-strzelba_asg_spas12_w.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1337232\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.78125\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.1%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/749\/1337232-strzelba_asg_spas12_w.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1337232\"><img alt=\"A real-world example of a SPAS-12 with pistol grip.\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/749\/1337232-strzelba_asg_spas12_w.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/749\/1337232-strzelba_asg_spas12_w.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/749\/1337232-strzelba_asg_spas12_w.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/749\/1337232-strzelba_asg_spas12_w.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/749\/1337232-strzelba_asg_spas12_w.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A real-world example of a SPAS-12 with pistol grip.\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/749\/1337232-strzelba_asg_spas12_w.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/749\/1337232-strzelba_asg_spas12_w.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_super\/0\/749\/1337232-strzelba_asg_spas12_w.jpg 960w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_medium\/0\/749\/1337232-strzelba_asg_spas12_w.jpg 480w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/749\/1337232-strzelba_asg_spas12_w.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>A real-world example of a SPAS-12 with pistol grip.<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Like any shotgun, the SPAS-12 (or SP-12, as it is identified in-game) decreases in usefulness across longer ranges.

Initially it is a small weapon, let down by its similarly small magazine size.

Without the Rail Mount the RDS cannot be purchased and mounted on the weapon, so it is definitely a worthwhile purchase for this reason. It doesn't need to be purchased unless the Red Dot Sight will be used though, as it provides no other benefits.<\/p><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><p>Magnum Ammo<\/p><\/td><td><p>Magnum Ammo is louder and has more recoil than standard or low velocity ammunition, but it shreds a target apart with ease. It also rips through doors, so if stealth isn't a concern, why not leave a 'lasting impression' upon the target? With massive power, a shot or two in the chest area will almost always yield results.<\/p><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><p><b>3<\/b><\/p><\/td><td><p>Rapid Fire<\/p><\/td><td><p>A massively increased rate of fire, which is very useful with the smaller frame and shorter barrel.

There were at least four ads for the game, and these ads featured slightly different taglines. The most controversial advert read 'Beautifully Executed', and featured a woman lying on a bed, apparently asleep.

It sets up the basis of who 47 is and who created him among other things.<\/p><p>The game starts with <a href=\"\/agent-47\/3005-889\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-889\">47<\/a> waking up in a sterile looking area and being talked through an obstacle course by a man on a speaker system. This man is <a href=\"\/dr-otto-wolfgang-ort-meyer\/3005-3879\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3879\">Dr. Otto Wolfgang Ort-Meyer<\/a>, a doctor at a sanitarium in Romania (however the player does not realize this yet). He sets up a way for 47 to escape, making him think that he accomplished this feat on his own. A year later 47 is working for the <a href=\"\/the-agency\/3015-1075\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1075\">International Contract Agency (The Agency),<\/a> as a freelance assassin taking on lucrative and dangerous contracts. It is believed that Dr. Ort-Meyer had a hand in pulling some strings to get 47 into The Agency, as a test to see if 47 had what it really takes to be the super assassin he was designed to be.<\/p><p>During this time working for <a href=\"\/the-agency\/3015-1075\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1075\">The Agency<\/a>, 47 has already established a reputation for being one of the best assassins in the organization. Players go through several missions in the game, delivered to them by <a href=\"\/computer\/3055-89\/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-89\">computer<\/a>. Agent 47's contact in <a href=\"\/the-agency\/3015-1075\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1075\">The Agency<\/a> is called <a href=\"\/diana-burnwood\/3005-1841\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1841\">Diana Burnwood<\/a>. There are always a few small missions setting up the big hit at the end of an \"episode\".<\/p><p>First 47 must assassinate <a href=\"\/lee-hong\/3005-5066\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5066\">Lee Hong<\/a>, the head of the Red Dragon Triad. All these missions take place in <a href=\"\/hong-kong\/3035-1083\/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1083\">Hong Kong<\/a>. His next major target is <a href=\"\/pablo-belisario-ochoa\/3005-5130\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5130\">Pablo Belisario Ochoa<\/a>, a Colombian druglord. Next is an Austrian terrorist named <a href=\"\/franz-fuchs\/3005-5166\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5166\">Franz Fuchs<\/a> followed by the gunrunner <a href=\"\/arkadij-boris-jegorov\/3005-5177\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5177\">Arkadij Jegorov<\/a> (aka Boris Ivanovich Duruska).<\/p><p>Throughout these missions players can collect various letters which their main targets sent to each other. In fact, it appears they were all members of the French Foreign Legion at the same time. All of the letters contain something about an experimental human, and they all seem to know a 'Professor' Ort-Meyer.<\/p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/993\/393872-hitman_fiber_wire.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-393872\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"360\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 360px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/993\/393872-hitman_fiber_wire.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-393872\"><img alt=\"The fiberwire in action\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/993\/393872-hitman_fiber_wire.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/993\/393872-hitman_fiber_wire.jpg 360w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/993\/393872-hitman_fiber_wire.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The fiberwire in action\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/993\/393872-hitman_fiber_wire.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/0\/993\/393872-hitman_fiber_wire.jpg 360w, https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/scale_small\/0\/993\/393872-hitman_fiber_wire.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"><\/noscript><\/a><figcaption>The fiberwire in action<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>At the end of the final contract, <a href=\"\/diana-burnwood\/3005-1841\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1841\">Diana<\/a> warns Agent 47 that something is amiss. All the previous hits were ordered from the same client. and this client has ordered one more hit on a Doctor Odon Kovacs, who so happens to work at a sanitarium in Romania. When 47 checks in, he learns that the mysterious voice from the start of the game is actually 'Professor' Ort-Meyer, as he calls in S.W.A.T. who start a search of the building for an intruder.<\/p><p>Once 47 kills his target, he must find a way deeper into the building. 47 finds help in Agent Smith (A recurring CIA agent in the Hitman franchise, which 47 comes into contact with in every game). Agent Smith tells him that there is a secret underground laboratory in the sanitarium. Here he finds an advanced lab, resulting in 47 finally discovering the truth about himself.<\/p><p>It becomes clear that 47 is a genetically engineered <a href=\"\/clone\/3015-284\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-284\">clone<\/a>, who was derived from the DNA of the 4 criminal masterminds he was contracted to kill. Only one of these 'fathers' remains and that is Dr. Ort-Meyer. It is implied that Ort-Meyer put out the contracts on these men because they wanted the technology and clones he had been working on for their own purposes, which he obviously did not want.<\/p><p>When he reaches the lab, Ort-Meyer releases the next series of clones, the 48 series. These clones are more easily controllable and supposedly more efficient then 47. However 47 is superior to these mindless drones, dispatching them with a high powered mini-gun. He then gains access to the main lab in the back through a barcode scanner using one of the fallen 48's, where Dr. Ort-Meyer confronts him. He mistakes 47 for a 48 in the beginning, and so he has some time to decide what to do. Kill him, or let him be.<\/p><p>If 47 lets him be, he embraces and stuns him. This leads to the game starting over again. If 47 shoots him however, he will stumble back knocking over trays with a bullet wound to his stomach. 47 then walks up to him and kneels down behind him, with Ort-Meyers back leaning on his chest. Ort-Meyer says \"I didn't even recognize my own son.\" To which 47 responds by snapping his neck.<\/p><p>Many of the missions in Hitman: Codename 47 are reinvented in <a href=\"\/hitman-contracts\/3030-6601\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6601\">Hitman: Contracts<\/a>. This may have been done because of better technology at the time, and the fact that many people may have never played the first Hitman.  The scene where 47 snaps Dr. Otto Wolfgang Ort-Meyer's neck is also reflected upon in <a href=\"\/hitman-blood-money\/3030-11004\/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11004\">Hitman: Blood Money<\/a>, in a <a href=\"\/cutscene\/3015-22\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-22\">cutscene<\/a> where \u201c <a href=\"\/jack-alexander-leland-cayne\/3005-3749\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3749\">Jack\u201d Alexander Leland Cayne<\/a> is explaining how <a href=\"\/agent-47\/3005-889\/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-889\">47<\/a> killed Dr. Ort-Meyer.<\/p><h2>Missions (in chronological order)<\/h2><table><tbody><tr><th>Hong Kong<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><h3>1.

Being a smart fellow, he seeks refuge in a hotel to get aid from a doctor, but the pain is causing him to have feverish nightmares. Right there, in the dark apartment with the rain pouring down outside, he remembers some of his missions.<\/p><h2>Gameplay<\/h2><p>Hitman: Contracts continues the gameplay elements that made the first two games so popular. You're still a hitman who has to either rely on stealth or weaponry to take out his targets, and there are a lot of weapons to utilize! Unfortunately, players are encouraged to take a more careful route, as there's a rating system that acts as an incentive for stealthy play. You can only get the title \"Silent Assassin\" if you manage to kill your targets - and <i>only<\/i> your targets - without triggering any alarms or making anyone suspicious.<\/p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/146864\/2117100-char_hitman_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2117100\" data-size=\"small\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"1.14\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:114.0%\" href=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/146864\/2117100-char_hitman_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2117100\"><img alt=\"Poison\" src=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/146864\/2117100-char_hitman_2.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/static.giantbomb.com\/uploads\/original\/14\/146864\/2117100-char_hitman_2.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px\" data-width=\"561\"><\/a><figcaption>Poison<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Aside from the more straightforward ways of killing targets such as gunplay and strangulation, several missions allow the player more subtle ways to eliminate hits. For example, poisoning food and drink, or \"accidents\" involving the environment, e.g. falling from a balcony or dying from an excess of steam in a sauna. Contracts continues the trend of \" <a href=\"\/context-sensitive\/3015-190\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-190\">context sensitive<\/a>\" actions, which means that one button is used in multiple situations for multiple uses. For example, when the player is near a door, the context sensitive button will allow the player to perform door-relevant actions such as keyhole peeking, <a href=\"\/lock-picking\/3015-2820\/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2820\">lock-picking<\/a>, and simply opening it, but when the player is near an unconscious individual, the same button will allow the ability to either acquire the person's outfit or drag the body to an area where it can be hidden from guards.<\/p><p>Along with the context sensitive button, the suspicion meter returns as well; this meter informs players of how close they are to blowing their respective cover. Such actions like excessively running indoors, brandishing weapons openly, residing in restricted areas, or sneaking, can raise suspicion. As previously stated, if the suspicion meter fills, guards will open fire on sight of the player and the current cover becomes useless. Disguises can be either found in the environment or taken from indisposed bodies and can be used to access areas restricted to most individuals in a level. Guards can see through your disguise if you are careless, e.g. if guards in a level are all wielding shotguns, then if the player assumes the guise of a guard and is not armed with a shotgun, he will draw suspicion and potentially blow his cover.<\/p><h2>Missions (in chronological order)<\/h2><h3>1.

Follow the underground passages until you come to another elevator. Once inside, select the option \"Mansion\" on the elevator button. Once you are in the mansion section of the map look around until you find an office. On the desk is Orthmeyers Key card. Now beat the mission anyway you can and make sure you save your game. When you beat the game and are able to replay missions go back to Mission 1, Asylum Aftermath. Once you exit the winding hallway where you started look to your left and you will see a locked metal gate. Unlock the gate with Orthmeyers key cardI and you will find a demented patient walking with a minigun. Take it. You will also find the dual gold plated Desert Eagles in another locked room after you make your way through the hallway with the mirrors.
